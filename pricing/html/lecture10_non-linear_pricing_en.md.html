<h1>NON-LINEAR PRICING</h1>
<p>Sometimes we need to sell more than one unit of our good to each customer. </p>
<h2>1.QUANTITY DISCOUNTS</h2>
<p>The basic theory about oﬀering quantity discounts is that it allows you to serve high-valuation and low-valuation customers. High-valuation customers signal the fact they are high-valuation customers to you by purchasing in bulk. Low-valuation customers signal that they value your product less by buying fewer units but at a high unit price. </p>
<p>There are some practical problems: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are often practical problems when it comes to managing returns, as customers may buy more units to get the discount but expect to be refunded at the average per-unit price for the units they return. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ideal product is something like a banana, where resellers cannot store or hoard the product and it is diﬃcult and expensive to resell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There must be no realistic chance of hoarding of the product by consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Robinson-Patman Act was explicitly designed to try and prevent ﬁrms using these kind of non-linear tariffs to beneﬁt chain stores at the expense of ‘Mom and Pop’ stores </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.METERED PRICING</h2>
<p>Often some form of metered pricing arrangement is preferable where the buyer </p>
<p>purchases goods simply on the basis of usage. Variations along this theme are razor-blade models where the customer buys a low price durable (the razor) and then subsequently purchases high price consumables (the blades). </p>
<h2>3.VALUE-BASED PRICING METRICS</h2>
<p>With any form of pricing, the key to pricing multiple units of a good to each customer is to get the pricing metric right. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, for most information services it makes sense to price ‘per download’ rather than per minute. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It very rarely makes sense to charge per hour. </p>

</ul>
