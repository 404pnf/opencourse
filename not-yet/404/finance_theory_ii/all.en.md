Types of questions

Investment and financing decisions

- Your firm needs to raise capital to finance growth.  

- Should you issue debt or equity or obtain a bank loan?

- How will the stock market react to your decision? 

- If you choose debt, should the bonds be convertible?  callable? Long or short maturity?

- If you choose equity, what are the trade-offs between common and preferred stock?

Types of questions, cont.

Investment and financing decisions

- IBM recently announced that it would repurchase $2.5 billion in stock.  Its price jumped 7% after the announcement.  Why?  How would themarket have reacted if IBM increased dividends instead?  SupposeIntel made the same announcement.  Would we expect the same price response?

- Motorola wants to build a new chip factory in Ireland.  How willfluctuations in the foreign exchange rate affect the value of the project?  What are the risks?  What actions can Motorola take to hedge therisks?  More importantly, should it hedge the risks?  What are the costs and benefits?

11 M-M’s “Irrelevance” Theorem • • Proof: • • price. • Q.E.D. Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter MM Theorem (without taxes for now). Financing decisions are irrelevant for firm value. In particular, the choice of capital structure is irrelevant. From Finance Theory I, Purely financial transactions do not change the total cash flows and are therefore zero NPV investments. With no arbitrage opportunities, they cannot change the total Thus, they neither increase nor decrease firm value.

In all (i.e.,  both) states of the world, the following are equal: The sum of payoffs to Firm B’s debt and equity By value additivity,  D(B) + E(B) = E(A) next year: Firm A’s Equity Firm B’s Firm B’s Equity In state 1: 160 60 In state 2:

Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter If Firm A were to adopt Firm B’s capital structure, its total value would not be affected (and vice versa). This is because ultimately, its value is that of the cash flows generated by its operating assets (e.g., plant and inventories). The firm’s financial policy divides up this cashflow “pie” among different claimants (e.g., debtholders and equityholders). But the size (i.e.,  value) of the pie is independent

18 M-M: Intuition 2 • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Investors will not pay a premium for firms that undertake financial transactions that they can undertake themselves (at the same cost). For instance, they will not pay a premium for Firm A over Firm B for having less debt. Indeed, by combining Firm B’s debt and equity in appropriate proportions, any investor can in effect “unlever” Firm B and reproduce the cashflow of Firm A.

Finance Theory II

February 18 and 19, 2003

The Key Questions of Corporate Finance

- Valuation: How do we distinguish between good investment projects and bad ones?

- Financing: How should we finance the investment projects we choose to undertake?

(Real) Investment Policy

- “Which projects should the firm undertake?”

- Open a new plant?

- Increase R&amp;D?

- Scale operations up or down?

- Acquire another company?

- We know that real investments can create value

- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis

- Positive NPV projects add value

- We revisit this in the course’s  “Valuation” module (Part II)

Financing Policy

- Real investment policies imply funding needs

- We have tools to forecast the funding needs to follow a given real investment policy (from Wilson Lumber)

- But what is the best source of funds?

- Internal funds (i.e., Cash)?

- Debt (i.e., borrowing)?

- Equity (i.e., issuing stock)?

- Moreover, different kinds of ...

- Internal funds (e.g., cash reserves vs. cutting dividends)

- Debt (e.g., Banks vs. Bonds)

- Equity (e.g., VC vs. IPO)

Choosing an Optimal Capital Structure

- Is there an “optimal” capital structure, i.e., an optimal mix between debt and equity?

- More generally, can you add value on the RHS of the balance sheet, i.e.,  by following a good financial policy?

- If yes, does the optimal financial policy depend on the firm’s operations (Real Investment policy), and how?

- We study this in the course’s “Financing” module (Part I).

M-M’s “Irrelevance” Theorem

Assume

- Market efficiency and no asymmetric information 

- No taxes 

- No transaction or bankruptcy costs 

- Hold constant the firm’s investment policies 

Then

- The value of the firm is independent of its capital structure

- Financing decisions do not matter!

MM Theorem: Proof 2 (market efficiency)

Your firm decides to raise $100 million.

- Debt financing

- You sell bonds worth $100 million and receive $100 million in cash.

- Equity financing

- You sell stock worth $100 million and receive $100 million in cash.

MM Theorem: Proof 2 (market efficiency)

- All purely financial transactions are zero NPV investments, i.e., no arbitrage opportunity.

- Thus, they neither increase nor decrease firm value.

Consider two firms with identical assets (in $M):Firm A is all equity financed:Firm A’s value is V(A) = E(A)Firm B is financed with a mix of debt and equity:Debt with one year maturity and face value $60MMarket values of debt D(B) and equity E(B)Firm B’s value is (by definition) V(B) = D(B) + E(B)MM says:  V(A) = V(B)Asset value next year: Firm A Firm B In state 1: 160 160 In state 2: 40 40   

MM Theorem: Proof 3

![](images/lecture_04_capital_structure_1-b.en_img_14.jpg)

Firm A’s equity gets all cash flows Firm B’s cash flows are split between its debt and equity with debt being senior to equity.In all (i.e., both) states of the world, the following are equal:The payoff to Firm A’s equity The sum of payoffs to Firm B’s debt and equityBy value additivity,    E(A) = D(B) + E(B)Claim’s valueFirm A Firm B next year (Equity) Debt Equity In state 1: 160 60 100 In state 2: 40 40 0  

M-M Intuition 1

- If Firm A were to adopt Firm B’s capital structure, its total value would not be affected (and vice versa).

- This is because ultimately, its value is that of the cash flows generated by its operating assets (e.g., plant and inventories).

- The firm’s financial policy divides up this cashflow “pie” amongdifferent claimants (e.g., debtholders and equityholders).

- But the size (i.e., value) of the pie is independentof how the pie is divided up.

Example, cont.

- In case you forgot where value additivity comes from…

- Assume for instance that market values are:

- →D(B) = $50M

- →E(B) = $50M

- MM says: V(A) = D(B)+E(B) = $100M

- Suppose instead that E(A) = $105M.

- Can you spot an arbitrage opportunity?

Example, cont.

![](images/lecture_04_capital_structure_1-b.en_img_15.jpg)

Arbitrage strategy:Buy 1/1M of Firm B’s equity for $50Buy 1/1M of Firm B’s debt for $50Sell 1/1M of Firm A’s equity for $105Note: Combining Firm B’s debt and equity amounts to “undoing Firm B’s leverage” (see shaded cells). Today Next year State 1 Next year State 2 Firm B’s equity -$50 +$100 $0 Firm B’s debt -$50 +$60 +$40 Subtotal -$100 +$160 +$40 Firm A’s equity +$105 -$160 -$40 Total +$5 $0 $0   

M-M: Intuition 2

- Investors will not pay a premium for firms that undertake financial transactions that they can undertake themselves (at the same cost).

- For instance, they will not pay a premium for Firm A over Firm Bfor having less debt.

- Indeed, by combining Firm B’s debt and equity in appropriate proportions, any investor can in effect “unlever” Firm B and reproduce the cashflow of Firm A.

The Curse of M-M 

- M-M Theorem was initially meant for capital structure.

- But it applies to all aspects of financial policy:

- capital structure is irrelevant.

- long-term vs. short-term debt is irrelevant.

- dividend policy is irrelevant.

- risk management is irrelevant.

- etc.

- Indeed, the proof applies to all financial transactions because they are all zero NPV transactions.

Using M-M Sensibly

- M-M is not a literal statement about the real world. It obviously leaves important things out.

- But it gets you to ask the right question: How is this financing move going to change the size of the pie?

- M-M exposes some fallacies such as: 

- WACC fallacy

- Win-Win fallacy

- EPS fallacy

WACC Fallacy: “Debt is Better Because Debt Is Cheaper Than Equity.”

- Because (for essentially all firms) debt is safer than equity, investors demand a lower return for holding debt than for holding equity. (True)

- The difference is significant: 4% vs. 13% expected return!

- So, companies should always finance themselves with debt because they have to give away less returns to investors, i.e., debt is cheaper. (False)

- What is wrong with this argument?

WACC Fallacy (cont.)

- This reasoning ignores the “hidden” cost of debt: 

- Raising more debt makes existing equity more risky

- Is it still true when default probability is zero?

- Milk analogy: Whole milk = Cream + Skimmed milk

- People often confuse the two meanings of “cheap”: 

- Low cost

- Good deal

- More on this in the “Valuation” module (Part II).

EPS Fallacy: “Debt is Better When It Makes EPS Go Up.”

- EPS can go up (or down) when a company increases its leverage. (True)

- Companies should choose their financial policy to maximize their EPS. (False)

- What is wrong with this argument?

EPS Fallacy (cont.)

- EBI(T) is unaffected by a change in capital structure (Recall that we assumed no taxes for now).

- Creditors receive the safe (or the safest) part of EBIT.

- Expected EPS might increase but EPS has become riskier!

Remarks:

- Also tells us to be careful when using P/E ratios, e.g. comparing P/E ratios of companies with different capital structures.

- Further confusing effect in share-repurchases: The number of shares changes as well as expected earnings.

Example 

Your firm is all equity financed and has $1 million of assets and 10,000 shares of stock (stock price = $100).  Earnings before interest and taxes next year will be either $50,000, $125,000, or $200,000 depending on economic conditions.  These earnings are expected to continue indefinitely.  The payout ratio is 100%.

The firm is thinking about a leverage recapitalization, selling $300,000 of debt and using the proceeds to repurchase stock.  The interest rate is 10%.

How would this transaction affect the firm’s EPS and stock price? Ignore taxes.

Win-Win Fallacy: “Debt Is Better Because Some Investors Prefer Debt to Equity.”

- Investors differ in their preferences and needs, and thus want different cash flow streams. (True)

- Example: Young professionals vs. Retirees

- The sum of what all investors will pay is greater if the firm issues different securities (e.g., debt and equity) tailored for different clienteles of investors (Financial Marketing). (False)

- What is wrong with this argument?

Win-Win Fallacy (cont.)

- This reasoning assumes incomplete markets, i.e., that:

- There are indeed clienteles for different securities

- These clienteles are “unsatisfied”, i.e., that investors cannot replicate the security at the same or even lower cost.

- A large unsatisfied clientele for corporate debt is unlikely, asthere exist close substitutes to any particular firm’s debt.

- Also, financial intermediaries are in the business of identifying unsatisfied clientele.

- Win-Win situation is more likely for more exotic securities or sophisticated financial arrangement

Practical Implications

- When evaluating a decision (e.g., the effect of a merger):

- →Separate financial (RHS) and real (LHS) parts of the move

- →MM tells that most value is created on LHS

- When evaluating an argument in favor of a financial decision:

- →Understand that it is wrong under MM assumptions

- →What departures from MM assumptions does it rely upon?

- →If none, then this is very dubious argument.

- →If some, try to assess their magnitude.

What’s Missing from the Simple M-M Story?

- Taxes:

- →Corporate taxes

- →Personal taxes

- Costs of Financial Distress

Capital Structure and Corporate Taxes 

- Different financial transactions are taxed differently:

- →Interest payments are tax exempt for the firm.

- →Dividends and retained earnings are not.

- →Etc.

- Financial policy matters because it affects a firm’s tax bill.

Debt Tax Shield

Claim: Debt increases firm value by reducing the tax burden.

- Example: XYZ Inc. generates a safe $100M annual perpetuity. Assume risk-free rate of 10%. Compare:

- 100% debt: perpetual $100M interest

- 100% equity: perpetual $100M dividend or capital gains

![](images/lecture_04_capital_structure_1-b.en_img_29.jpg)

 100% Debt 100% Equity Income before tax Interest Income $100M Equity income $100M Corporate tax rate 35% 0 -$35M Income after tax $100M $65M Firm value $1,000M $650M   

Intuition

- MM still holds: The pie is unaffected by capital structure.

Size of the pie = Value of before-taxcashflows

- But the IRS gets a slice too

- Financial policy affects the size of that slice.

- Interest payments being tax deductible, the PV of the IRS’ slicecan be reduced by using debt rather than equity.

Example 

In 2000, Microsoft had sales of $23 billion, earnings before taxes of $14.3 billion, and net income of $9.4 billion.  Microsoft paid $4.9 billion in taxes, had a market value of $423 billion, and had no long-term debt outstanding.

Bill Gates is thinking about a recapitalization, issuing $50 billion in long-term debt (rd = 7%) and repurchasing $50 billion in stock.  How would this transaction affect Microsoft’safter-tax cashflowsand shareholder wealth?

Remarks

- Raising debt does not create value, i.e., you can’t create valueby borrowing and sitting on the excess cash.

- It creates value relative to raising the same amount in equity.

- Hence, value is created by the tax shield when you:

- →finance an investment with debt rather than equity

- →undertake a recapitalization, i.e., a financial transaction in which some equity is retired and replaced with debt.

Back to the Microsoft example…

What would be the value of tax shields for Microsoft?

- Interest expense = $50 ×0.07 = $3.5 billion

- Interest tax shield = $3.5 ×0.34 = $1.19 billion

- PV(taxshields) =1.19 / 0.07 = 50 ×0.34 = $17 billion

- VL= Vu+ PV(taxshields) = $440 billion

Is This Important or Negligible?

- Firm A has no debt and is worth V(all equity).

- Suppose Firm A undertakes a leveraged recapitalization:

- →issues debt worth D,

- →and buys back equity with the proceeds.

- Its new value is:

- Thus, with corporate tax rate t= 35%:

- →for D = 20%, firm value increases by about 7%.

- →for D = 50%, it increases by about 17.5%.

Bottom Line

- Tax shield of debt matters, potentially a lot.

- Pie theory gets you to ask the right question: How does this financing choice affect the IRS’ bite of the corporate pie?

- It is standard to use τ*D for the capitalization of debt’s tax break.

- Caveats:

- →Not all firms face full marginal tax rate

- →Personal taxes

Marginal tax rate (MTR)

- Present value of current and expected future taxes paid on $1 of additional income

- Why could the MTR differ from the statutory tax rate?

- Current losses

- Tax-Loss Carry Forwards (TLCF)

Tax-Loss Carry Forwards (TLCF)

- Current losses can be carried backward/forward for 3/15 years

- Can be used to offset past profitsand get tax refund

- Can be used to offset future profitsand reduce future tax bill

- Valuing TLCF, need to incorporate time value of money

- Bottom line: More TLCF Less debt

Tax-Loss Carry Forwards (TLCF): Example

MTR at time 0= PV (Additional Taxes) = 0.35/1.12 = 0.29

Personal Taxes

- Investors’ return from debt and equity are taxed differently

- Interest and dividends are taxed as ordinary income

- Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate

- Capital gains can be deferred (contrary to dividends and interest)

- Corporations have a 70% dividend exclusion

- So: For personal taxes, equity dominates debt.

- Taxes favor debt for most firms

- We will lazily ignore personal taxation in the rest of the course

- But, beware of particular cases

The Dark Side of Debt: Cost of Financial Distress

- If taxes were the only issue, (most) companies would be 100% debt financed

- Common sense suggests otherwise 

- If the debt burden is too high, the company will have trouble paying

- The result: financial distress

Costs of Financial Distress

- Firms in financial distress perform poorly

- Is this poor performance an effect or a cause of financial distress?

- Financial distress sometimes results in partial or complete liquidation of the firm’s assets

- Would this not occur otherwise?

![](images/lecture_06_capital_structure_2-b.en_img_16.jpg)

Do not confuse causes and effects of financial distress.  Only the effectsshould be counted as costs!

Costs of Financial Distress

Direct Bankruptcy Costs:

- Legal costs, etc…

Indirect Costs of Financial Distress:

- Debt overhang: Inability to raise funds to undertake good investments

- →Pass up valuable investment projects

- →Competitors may take this opportunity to be aggressive

- Risk taking behavior -gambling for salvation

- Scare off customers and suppliers

Direct Bankruptcy Costs

- What are direct bankruptcy costs?

- Legal expenses, court costs, advisory fees…

- Also opportunity costs, e.g., time spent by dealing with creditors

- How important are direct bankruptcy costs?

- Prior studies find average costs of 2-6% of total firm value

- Percentage costs are higher for smaller firms

- But this needs to be weighted by the bankruptcy probability!

- Overall, expecteddirect costs tend to be small

Debt Overhang

- XYZ has assets in place (with idiosyncratic risk) worth:

- In addition, XYZ has $15M in cash

- This money can be either paid out as a dividend or invested

- XYZ’sproject is:

- Today: Investment outlay $15M, next year: safe return $22M

- Should XYZ undertake the project?

- Assume: risk-free rate = 10%

- NPV= -15 + 22/1.1 = $5M

Debt Overhang (cont.)

- Shareholders would:

- →Incur the full investment cost: -$15M

- →Receive only part of the return (22 only in the good state)

- Existing creditors would:

- →Incur none of the investment cost

- →Still receive part of the return (22 in the bad state)

- So, existing risky debt acts as a “tax on investment”

![](images/lecture_06_capital_structure_2-b.en_img_21.jpg)

Shareholders of firms in financial distress may be reluctant to fund valuable projects because most of the benefits would go to the firm’s existing creditors.

Debt Overhang (cont.)

- What if the probability of the bad state is 2/3 instead of 1/2?

- The creditor grab part of the return even more often.

- The “tax” of investment is increased.

- The shareholders are even less inclined to invest.

![](images/lecture_06_capital_structure_2-b.en_img_22.jpg)

Companies find it increasingly difficult to invest as financial distress becomes more likely.

What Can Be Done About It?

- New equity issue?

- New debt issue?

- Financial restructuring?

- Outside bankruptcy

- Under a formal bankruptcy procedure

Raising New Equity?

- Suppose you raise outside equity

- New shareholders must break even:

- They may be paying the investment cost

- But only because they receive a fair payment for it

- This means someone else is de facto incurring the cost:

- The existing shareholders!

- So, they will refuse again

![](images/lecture_06_capital_structure_2-b.en_img_23.jpg)

Firms in financial distress may be unable to raise funds from new investors because most of the benefits would go to the firm’s existing creditors.

Financial Restructuring?

![](images/lecture_06_capital_structure_2-b.en_img_24.jpg)

In principle, restructuring could avoid the inefficiency:debt for equity exchangedebt forgiveness or reschedulingSuppose creditors reduce the face value to $24Mconditionally on the firm raising new equity to fund the projectWill shareholders go ahead with the project?Restructure?StateProba.AssetsCreditorsShareholdersNOGood1/21003565Bad1/210100YESGood1/21222498Bad1/232248

Financial Restructuring? (cont.)

- Incremental cash flow to shareholders from restructuring:

- 98 -65 = $33M with probability 1/2

- 8 -0 = $8M with probability 1/2

- They will go ahead with the restructuring deal because:

- -15 + [(1/2)*33 + (1/2)*8]/1.1 = $3.6M &gt; 0

- Recall our assumption: discount everything at 10%

- Creditors are also better-off because they get:

- 5 -3.6 = $1.4M

Financial Restructuring? (cont.)

- When evaluating financial distress  costs, account for the possibility of (mutually beneficial) financial restructuring.

- In practice, perfect restructuring is not always possible.

- But you should ask: What are limits to restructuring?

- Banks vs. bonds

- Few vs. many banks

- Bank relationship vs. arm’s length finance

- Simple vs. complex debt structure (e.g., number of classes with different seniority, maturity, security, ….)

Issuing New Debt

- Issuing new debt with lower seniorityas the existing debt

- Will not improve things: the “tax” is unchanged

- Issuing debt with same seniority

- Will mitigate but not solve the problem: a (smaller) tax remains

- Issuing debt with higher seniority

- Avoids the tax on investment because gets a larger part of payoff

- Similar: debt with shorter maturity (de facto senior)

- However, this may be prohibited by covenants

Bankruptcy

- This analysis has implications which are recognized in the Bankruptcy Law.

- Bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code:

- Provides a formal framework for financial restructuring

- Debtor in Possession: Under control by the court, the company can issue debt senior to existing claims despite covenants

Debt Overhang: Preventive Measures

- Firms which are likely to enter financial distress should avoid too much debt

- If you cannot avoid leverage, at least you should structure your liabilities so that they are easy to restructure if needed:

- Active management of liabilities  

- Bank debt

- Few banks

Example

- Your firm has $50 in cash and is currently worth $100.  

- You have the opportunity to acquire an internet start-up for $50.

- The start-up will either be worth $0 (prob= 2/3) or $120 (prob= 1/3) in one year.  

- Assume the discount rate is 0%.

- Would you invest in the start-up if your firm is all-equity financed?

- What if the firm has debt outstanding with a face value of $80?

If all equity

Expected payoff = 0.66 ×0 + 0.33 ×120 = $40

NPV = -50 + 40 = –$10→Reject!

Example, cont.

If leveraged (debt=$80):

- Without project:  equity = $20, debt = $80

With project

![](images/lecture_06_capital_structure_2-b.en_img_25.jpg)

Lucky (p=1/3)Unlucky (p=2/3)V=$170E=$90 D=$80V=$50E=$0 D=$50

![](images/lecture_06_capital_structure_2-b.en_img_26.jpg)

With project:  equity = $30, debt = $60   →Accept!What is happening?

Excessive Risk-Taking

- The project is a bad gamble (NPV&lt;0) but the shareholders are essentially gambling with the creditors’ money.

- Implication: Firms in distress will adopt excessively risky strategies to “go for broke”.

- Firms will tend to liquidate assets too late and remain in business for too long.

Excessive Risk-Taking: Intuition

Equity holders have unlimited upside potential but bounded losses

Textbook View of Optimal Capital Structure

1.Start with M-M Irrelevance

2.Add two ingredients that change the size of the pie.

- →Taxes

- →Expected Distress Costs

3.Trading off the two gives you the “static optimum” capital structure. (“Static” because this view suggests that a company should keep its debt relatively stable over time.)

Practical Implications

- Companies with “low” expected distress costs should load up on debt to get tax benefits.

- Companies with “high” expected distress costs should be more conservative.

Expected Distress Costs

Thus, all substance lies in having an idea of what industry and company traits lead to potentially high expected distress costs.

Expected Distress Costs =

(Probability of Distress) * (Distress Costs)

Identifying Expected Distress Costs

- Probability of Distress

- Volatile cash flows

-industry change-macro shocks

-technology change-start-up

- Distress Costs

- Need external funds to invest in CAPX or market share

- Financially strong competitors

- Customers or suppliers care about your financial position (e.g., because of implicit warranties or specific investments)

- Assets cannot be easily redeployed

Setting Target Capital Structure:

A Checklist

- Taxes

- Does the company benefit from debt tax shield?

- Expected Distress Costs

- Cashflowvolatility

- Need for external funds for investment

- Competitive threat if pinched for cash

- Customers care about distress

- Hard to redeploy assets

Does the Checklist Explain Observed Debt Ratios?

![](images/lecture_06_capital_structure_2-b.en_img_30.jpg)

  Industry Debt Ratio (%)  Electric and Gas43.2  Food Production22.9  Paper and Plastic30.4  Equipment19.1  Retailers21.7  Chemicals17.3  Computer Software3.5

What Does the Checklist Explain?

- Explains capital structure differences at broad level, e.g., between Electric and Gas (43.2%) and Computer Software (3.5%). In general, industries with more volatile cash flows tend to have lower leverage.

- Probably not so good at explaining small difference in debt ratios, e.g., between Food Production (22.9%) and Manufacturing Equipment (19.1%).

- Other factors, such as sustainable growth, are also important.

Key Points

- Recall the tension in Wilson Lumber between product market goals (fast growth) and financial goals (modest leverage).

- Fast growing companies reluctant to issue equity end up with debt ratios greater than the target implied by the checklist.

- Slowly growing companies reluctant to buy back equity or increase dividends end up with debt ratios below the target implied by the checklist.

Key Points

- O.K. to stray somewhat from target capital structure.

- But keep in mind: Fast growth companies that stray too far from the target with excessive leverage, risk financial distress.

- Ultimately, must have a consistent product market strategy and financial strategy.

Upon seeing the firm issuing equity, the market infers that it must be sitting on negative info: assets are worth only $50M. Given the market’s expectations that the firm was worth $100M, the firm’s market value drops to 50 + 20 = $70M when the firm announces the equity issue.

Firms with more information asymmetries are more reluctant to issue equity, and try to preserve borrowing capacity.

Contrary to the Target Capital Structure Approach, the Pecking Order implies that capital structure can move around a lot. The Pecking Order Theory also implies that profitable firms will lower their leverage ratios to build up “financial slack”. The idea is to avoid future equity issues in case unexpected funding needs arise.

Implications of the “target leverage” approach

- Firms should:

- Issue equity when leverage rises above the target level

- Buy back stock (or pay dividends) when leverage falls below the target capital structure

- Stock market should:

- React positively (or neutrally) to announcements  of securities issues

What really happens?

- Stock prices drop (on average) at the announcements of equity issues

- Companies are reluctant to issue equity

- They follow a “pecking order” in which they finance investment:

- first with internally generated funds

- and finally with equity

Incorporating These Concerns

- The irrelevance of financing comes from the fact that existing shareholders (represented by managers) and new shareholders agree on the value of financial claims.

- Everybody agrees on the size of the “pie”

- This ensures that financial transactions have NPV = 0.

- Departing from this framework:

- Inefficient markets

- Irrational managers

- Managers with more information than investors

- Managers prefer to issue equity when equity is overvalued

- Thus, equity issues signal to investors that equity is overvalued

- Thus, stock price declines at equity issues announcements

- Consequently, managers avoid issuing equity

- In some cases, they may even forgo positive NPV projects rather than issue equity

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_7.jpg)

Managers with more information than investors-The Lemons Problem

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_8.jpg)

Suppose that managers have more information about the firm than outside investors. 

Equity financing: Example

Let’s set aside taxes and financial distress

- XYZ’s assets in place are subject to idiosyncratic risk:

- New investment project:

- Discount rate: 10%

- Investment outlay: $12M

- Safe return next year: $22M ==&gt; PV = 22/1.1 = $20M

NPV =  -12 + 20 = $8M

- Should XYZ undertake the project?

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_9.jpg)

150p=0.550p=0.5Assets value

Case 1: Managers know as much as outside investors

- Suppose that XYZ has $12M in cash for investment

- If internally financed with cash, existing shareholders realize the full $8M NPV of the investment.

- Suppose that XYZ does not have the cash but can issue $12M in equity

- Once the project funded, the firm is worth 100 + 20 = $120M

- Raise $12M by selling 10% of shares (after issue)

- Existing shareholders get 90% * 120 = $108M

- To be compared with $100M if did not invest

- Existing shareholders gain $8M

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_10.jpg)

With no information asymmetries, managers are indifferent between internal and external financing

Case 2: Managers know more than outside investors

- Internal financing

- As before, existing shareholders gain $8M

- Equity financing

- Raise $12M by selling 10% of shares (after issue), valued by themarket at 120 (i.e., 100 + 20).

- Existing shareholders get 90% * (150 + 20) = $153M.

- Existing shareholders gain only $3M

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_11.jpg)

When equity is undervalued, managers prefer to finance internally than to issue equity

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_12.jpg)

150p=0.5150p=150p=0.5ShareholdersManagersAssets value from the perspective of

Case 2 (cont.): How about debt financing?

- With debt financing:

- Raise $12M and repay (1.1) * 12 = $13.2M next year

- Existing shareholders get the full $8M because:

150 + (22 -13.2)/1.1  = $158M

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_13.jpg)

When equity is undervalued, managers prefer to finance with debt than equity

Why Is Safe Debt Better Than Equity?

- Its value is independent of the information

- Managers and the market give it the same value

- Safe debt is fairly priced no lemon’s problem

- Risky debt is somewhere “between” safe debt and equity

- There is some lemon’s problem associated with risky debt but it is less severe than with equity

Lemon’s problem: Implications

- If your assets are worth $150M, you will not want to issue equity, but will finance internally or with debt

- If you choose to issue equity, investors will know that your assets must be worth only $50M

- Consequently, stock price will fall when you announce an equity issue

- By how much?

Example (cont.): Market Reaction

- Recall market’s expectations

- Assets are $150 (prob. = ½) or $50 (prob. = ½)

- So currently, assets are valued at $100

- Upon seeing an equity issue, the market infers that the firm is sitting on negative info:

- assets are worth only $50M

- The firm’s market value drops to 50 + 20 = $70 when equity issue is announced and new equity is issued

Evidence on equity issue announcements

Average cumulative excess returns from 10 days before to 10 daysafter announcement for 531 common stock offerings (Asquith and Mullins (1986))

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_14.jpg)

-3.5-3-2.5-2-1.5-1-0.500.5-10-8-6-4-20246810Day after announcementCumulative Excess Return (%)

Evidence on announcement effects

- Stock price reaction to issues:

- Straight Debt:Little or no effect

- Convertible Debt:-2%  (9% of proceeds)

- Equity:-3%  (25% of proceeds)

- Stock repurchases:  +13%

Example (cont.): Underinvestment

- Suppose investment outlay is $18M not $12M.

NPV = -18 + 22/1.1 = $2M

- Raising $18M requires selling 15% of shares

- Existing shareholders get 85% * (150 + 20) = $144.5M

- They lose $5.5M relative to $150M if did not invest.

- XYZ will not issue equity to fund project.

Key Point: Investment Depends on Financing

- Some projects will be undertaken only if funded internally or with relatively safe debt

- Information asymmetries can lead companies to forgo good project

- Companies with less cash and more leverage will be more prone to this underinvestment problem

- Issuing safe debt is more difficult at high leverage

- Also, issuing too much debt may lead to financial distress

Pecking Order and Capital Structure

- Basic Pecking Order:

- Firms will use cash when available

- Otherwise use debt

- High cash-flow ==&gt; No need to raise debt==&gt;In fact, can repay some debt

==&gt;Leverage ratio decreases

- Low cash-flow ==&gt; Need to raise debt==&gt;Reluctance to raise equity

==&gt;Leverage ratio increases

Key Point

- If Pecking Order holds, a company’s leverage ratio results:

- not from an attempt to approach a target ratio;

- but rather from series of incremental financing  decisions.

- Contrary to the Target Capital Structure Approach, the Pecking Order implies that capital structure can move around a lot.

Key Point: Timing of Equity Issues

- There may be ''good'' and ''bad'' times to issue stock.

- Best not to issue when lots of information asymmetry --i.e., should issue when price impact of issue is lowest.

Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) 1960-99

Evidence on timing of equity issues

- Firms tend to issue more equity in booms and less in busts

- NPV of investment opportunities are higher, so firms are willingto incur the costs of issuing equity

- In fact, when lots of firms are issuing, the stock price impact of an equity issue is low

- Caveat:Is this because information problems are lower or because stock markets are inefficient --i.e., systematically mispriceequity?

Managerial Behavior and Capital Structure

- So far, we assumed that managers act in the interest of shareholders. 

- But is it always true?

- Conflicts of interests between managers and shareholders are called agency problems

Agency Problems

- Agents do not always do their job =&gt; costs to principals

- These cost are called “Agency Costs”

- They are reflected in a lower share price

- Potential problems:

- Shirking

- Empire Building

- Perks (private jets)

- Risk avoidance

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_19.jpg)

Principals = Shareholders

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_20.jpg)

Agents = Managers

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_21.jpg)

Avoiding Agency Costs

- Compensation policy

- Monitoring managers’ actions

- Independent directors on the Board

- Banks as lenders

- Large block holders

- Market for Corporate Control (i.e. takeovers)

- Can leverage help to avoid agency costs?

A Classic Agency Problem: The Free Cash Flow Problem

- Free Cash Flow (FCF)

- Cash flow in excess of that needed to fund all positive NPV projects

- Managers may be reluctant to pay out FCF to shareholders

- Empire building through unprofitable acquisitions

- Pet projects, prestige investments, perks

- This problem is more severe for “cash cows”

- Firms with lots of cash (i.e., profitable firms)

- And few good investment opportunities

Example of FCF Problems

Evidence from the Oil Industry (Jensen, 1986)

- From 1973 to 1979: tenfold increase in crude oil prices

- Oil industry expanded

- Oil consumption fell

- The oil industry at the end of 1970s

- Lots of excess capacity

- Lots of cash (because of high prices)

- What did managers do?

Example of FCF Problems (cont.)

What did managers do?

- They did not pay out cash to shareholders

- Continued spending on exploration and development (E&amp;D)

- Stock prices reacted negatively to the announcements of increases in E&amp;D by oil companies during 1975 –81

- Invested outside of industry

- Mobile purchased Marcor(retail)

- Exxon purchased Reliance Electric (manufacturing) and Vydec(office equipment)

- These acquisitions turned out to be least successful of the decade

Can leverage reduce FCF problem?

- Debt = commitment to distribute cash flows in the future

- If managers cannot keep the promise to pay interest (principal),bondholders can shut down the firm

- Thus, debt reduces FCF available to managers

- Less opportunities for managers to waist cash

- How about commitment to pay dividends?

- Dividends also reduce FCF

- But a commitment to pay dividends cannot be enforced

Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)

- LBO is a going-private transaction

- Typically, incumbent management acquires all publicly-traded shares

- LBOsare often financed with debt (D/E ratios of 10 are not uncommon)

- Kaplan (1989 JFE) finds in a sample of 76 LBOs:

- Debt / Value went from 18.8% to 87.8%

- 42% premium paid to shareholders to go private

- In three years after the buyout

- Operating Income / TA  increased by 15%

- Operating Income / Sales increased by 19%

- Net cash flow increased and capital expenditures decreased

- Do LBOsimprove efficiency through the control function of debt?

Capital Structure: An Extended Checklist

- Taxes

- Does the company benefit from debt tax shield?

- Information Problems

- Do outside investors understand the funding needs of the firm?

- Would an equity issue be perceived as bad news by the market?

- Agency Problems

- Does the firm have a free cash flow problem?

- Expected Distress Costs

- What is the probability of distress? (Cash flow volatility)

- What are the costs of distress? 

- Need funds for investment, competitive threat if pinched for cash,  customers care about distress, assets difficult to redeploy?

Avoid fallacies such as mechanical effects on accounting measures (e.g., WACC fallacy, EPS fallacy) Ask yourself, what frictions does the argument rely on?

This is because interest payments are tax deductible. Personal taxes tend to reduce but not offset this effect. This is counterbalanced by the expected costs of financial Expected costs of financial distress (Probability of Distress) * (Costs if actually in distress)

This implies that firms: Preferably use retained earnings, Then borrow from debt market, As a last resort, issue equity.

Finance Theory II

March 11, 2003

Overview of Financing

Financial forecasting

- Short-run forecasting

- General dynamics: Sustainable growth.

Capital structure

- Describing a firm’s capital structure

- Benchmark: MM irrelevance

- Theory 1: Static Trade-Off Theory

- Theory 2: Pecking Order Theory

- An integrated approach

Note:Throughout we take “operations” as given.

Forecasting a Firm’s Funding Needs

- Question:Given our operations (and the forecast thereof), will we need funding, and how much?

- Short-run forecasting 

- General dynamics:

- The concept of sustainable growth

- Cash Cows and Finance junkies

Financial Forecasting: General Approach

- Need (a model of) the firm’s production function

- Use available data

- Common sense

- Specific knowledge of firm and industry

- Given this model forecast all items in the balance sheet except “funding needs”

- Infer the funding need from identity of Assets and Liabilities + Net Worth

Forecasting: Our approach

- Forecast Assets

- Forecast non-bank liabilities, excluding Net Worth

- Forecast Net Income

- Assume some starting value for Bank Loan = “Bank Plug”

- Forecast interest using Bank Plug

- Forecast Net Worth

- Consistency check: Assets = Liabilities + Net Worth?

- If yes, stop

- If not, adjust Bank Plug

- Recall: All we want are rough approximations

General Dynamics

- Sustainable Growth Rate:  g* = (1-d) * ROE

- Gives a (very rough) measure of how fast you can grow Assets without increasing your leverage ratio or issuing equity

- Sustainable growth rate increases when

- Dividends (d) decreases

- Profit margins (NI/Sales) increases

- Asset turnover (Sales/Assets) increases

- Leverage (Assets/NW) increases

Key Points

- Key Point 0: The concept of sustainable growth does not tell you whether growing is good or not

- Key Point 1:Sustainable growth is relevant only if you cannot or will not raise equity, and you cannot let D/E ratio increase

- Key Point 2: Sustainable growth gives a quick idea of general dynamics: Cash cows (g &lt;&lt; g*) or Finance junkies (g &gt;&gt; g*)

- Key Point 3: Financial and business strategies cannot be set independently

Capital Structure

- Describing a firm’s capital structure

- MM theorem

- Theory 1: Static Trade-off Theory

- Tax shield vs. Expected distress costs

- Theory 2: Pecking Order Theory

- Implications for investment 

- Implications for capital structure

- Pulling it all together

MM Theorem

- MM: In frictionless markets, financial policy is irrelevant.

- Finance Theory 1: Financial transactions are NPV=0. QED

- Corollary: All the following are irrelevant:

- Capital structure

- Long-vs. short-term debt

- Dividend policy

- Risk management

- Etc.

Evaluate the following statements

- Issuing equity dilutes earnings-per-share and thus hurts current shareholders.

- Equity in a levered firm is riskier than equity in an unlevered(but otherwise identical) firm.

- Currently, interest rates are high, so it is better to issue equity than debt.

- Currently, short-term interest rates are lower than long-term interest rates, so it is better to issue long-term than short-term debt.

Using MM Sensibly

When evaluating an argument in favor of a financial move:

- Ask yourself: Why is financing argument wrong under MM?

- Avoid fallacies such as mechanical effects on accounting measures (e.g., WACC, EPS, Win-win)

- Ask yourself, what frictions does the argument rely on?

- Taxes, Costs of financial distress, Information asymmetry, Agency problems

- If none, dubious argument. If some, evaluate magnitude.

Financing Choices

Equity

Debt

Theory 1: Static Trade-Off Theory

- Talks about costs and benefits of Debt relative to Equity

- The optimal target capital structure is determined by balancing

![](images/lecture_10_review_of_financing_and_capital_structure-b.en_img_1.jpg)

Note:The theory does not give you a precise target but rather a range, an order of magnitude.

![](images/lecture_10_review_of_financing_and_capital_structure-b.en_img_4.jpg)

Tax Shield of Debt

- Debt increases firm value by reducing corporate tax bill.

- This is because interest payments are tax deductible.

- Personal taxes tend to reduce but not offset this effect.

V(w/ debt) = V(all equity) + PV(tax shield)

- Order of magnitude for PV tax shield

- Constant debt level : t*D

- t = marginal tax rate depends on country, tax credits, etc.

Note:A move that increases firm value will increase equity value!

Expected Costs of Distress: Two Terms

Expected costs of financial distress

=

(Probability of Distress) * (Costs if actually in distress)

Probability of Distress

- Cashflowvolatility

- Is industry risky? Is firm’s strategy risky?

- Are there uncertainties induced by competition?

- Is there a risk of technological change?

- Sensitive to macroeconomic shocks, seasonal fluctuations?

- Etc.

- Use past data but also knowledge of industry.

- Beware of changes of environment.

Indirect costs of financial distress:

- Debt overhang: Inability to raise funds to undertake investments.

- Pass up valuable projects Do I need to invest?

- Rivals become aggressive Do I have aggressive rivals?

- Scare off customers and suppliers(e.g., implicit warranty or specific investment) Do other parties care?

- Asset fire salesAre assets easily re-deployable?

- Are my assets valuable to other firms? (e.g. R&amp;D)

- Who are potential buyers? How many? Will they be cash constrained when I want to sell my assets?

Checklist for Target Capital Structure

Tax Shield:

- Would the firm benefit from debt tax shield? Is it profitable? Does it have tax credits?

Expected distress costs:

- Are cashflowsvolatile?

- Need for external funds for investment?

- Competitive threat if pinched for cash?

- Customers and suppliers care about distress?

- Are assets easy to re-deploy?

- Note:Hard to renegotiate debt structure increases distress costs (Recall Massey’s complex debt structure).

Theory 2: Pecking Order

- Firms general financing choices:

- Preferably use retained earnings

- Then borrow from debt market

- As a last resort, issue equity

- Theory: Info. asymmetry between firm and market makes:

- External finance more costly than internal funds

- Debt less costly than equity (because less info-sensitive)

Implications for Investment

- The value of a project depends on how it is financed.

- Some projects will be undertaken only if funded internally or with relatively safe debt but not if financed with risky debt or equity.

- Companies with less cash and more leverage will be more prone to under-invest.

- Rationale for hoarding cash.

Implications for Capital Structure

- If a firm follows the Pecking Order, its leverage ratio results from a series of incremental decisions, not attempt to reach a target.

- High cash flow ==&gt; Leverage ratio decreases

- Low cash flow ==&gt; Leverage ratio increases

- There may be good and bad times to issue equity depending on the degree of information asymmetry.

- Rationale for hybrid instruments.

What Do We Do With Two Theories?

- Sometimes, both theories will give the same recommendation

- But sometimes, they will differ

- Consider Massey Ferguson:

- Static Trade-off theory ==&gt; Equity issue

- Pecking Order Theory ==&gt; Debt issue

- Two questions:

- Is one theory better at describing what firms do?

- Is one theory better at telling what they should be doing?

But As a Prescriptive Theory?

If firms use Pecking order blindly and ignore static trade-off:

- Cash cows will end up with too little leverage (UST).

- Good news: Never too late to lever-up

- Finance junkies will end up with too much leverage (Massey)

- Bad news: It can be too late to unlever(debt-overhang).

- ST debt is temporary relief but worsens things in fine.

DON'T TALK TO DEERE &amp; COMPANY ABOUT MARKET SIGNALING (from Higgins)

(Please see “Don’t Talk to Deere &amp; Company About Market Signaling” from the course 

textbook by Higgins.)

An Integrative Approach

- Each theory makes a statement about what is first order issue:

- STO: Tax shield and Distress costs

- PO: Information (Price of claims you issue)

- Both theories need not be incompatible:

- Use each when you think they emphasize the right issues

- When getting far away from target, STO type issues dominate

- When reasonably close to target, PO type issues dominate

An Integrative Approach (cont.)

- Establish long-run “target” capital structure

- Evaluate the true economic costs of issuing equity

- What is real cost of price hit vs. foregone investment or increase in expected cost of distress.

- If still reluctant to issue equity:

- Are there ways to reduce the cost? (e.g., give information)

- Will the cost be lower if you issue later?

- Can you use hybrids and packages to get there? But be careful. (Recall MCI might get stuck with too much debt)

An Integrative Approach (cont.)

- Straying from target may be warranted. But, be as systematic and precise as possible about justification --Are benefits from straying plausibly large relative to costs?

- Remember: Lion’s share of value is created on LHS. Don’t want to endanger operations. Beware excessive leverage. Ultimately, business strategy should drive financial strategy, not the otherway around.

- Avoid rules of thumb like: ''Never issue in a down market''; or ''Don't knock props out from under stock.'' These may make sense in some, but certainly not all circumstances.

Conclusion

- The bulk of the value is created on the LHS by making good investment decisions.

- You can destroy much value by mismanaging your RHS: Financial policy should be supporting your business strategy.

- You cannot make sound financial decisions without knowing the implications for the business.

- Finance is too serious to leave it to finance people.

Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Dividend and Payout Policy (for you to read)

2 • →→• →→→• • →→Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Dividend Policy (aka Payout Policy) Firms transfer funds to shareholders through: cash dividends share repurchases Payout Policy: How is money being paid out? How often is money being paid out? How much money is being paid? Main question: What payout policy should a firm follow? We need to know: Whether a firm’s value depends on its dividend policy? If so, why and how?

3 • • • →→• →→→Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Payout Method 1: Cash Dividends The level of dividends is not fixed (contrary to interest) and can be changed by the firm at any time. Usually, dividends are paid quarterly. Companies distinguish between Regular dividends: expected to be maintained in the future Special dividends: less likely to be repeated Dividends are reported in three equivalent ways: Dividend per share (DPS): dollar amount per share Dividend yield: DPS divided by share price Payout ratio: DPS divided by EPS

Usually, they are kept in the firm’s treasury. They may be resold when the firm needs to issue new shares. In many countries, repurchases are not allowed.

5 M-M Dividend Irrelevance • Proof: • • don’t pay dividends • Q.E.D. Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter What does M&amp;M say? In perfect capital markets the value of a firm is independent of its payout policy. Paying dividends is a Zero NPV transaction – so the value of the firm before paying dividends must equal the value of the firm after paying dividends plus the value of the dividends. In perfect capital markets, investors who want dividends can replicate dividends by selling part of their holdings in companies that In perfect capital markets, investors who don’t want dividends can replicate a no-dividend stock by reinvesting their dividends 

![](images/lecture_11_intel_corporation_1992.en_img_5.jpg)

6 Example of Dividend Irrelevance: • • →→= • →→• Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter XYZ generates a $1M annual perpetuity and the required return on its stock is 10%. It has 100,000 shares outstanding. The current dividend policy is given by: Pay out all cash flows as annual cash dividends, i.e., DPS = $10 Then XYZ’s market value is : $1M / 10%  $10M, and the stock price is $100 Now consider an alternative dividend policy: Increase next year’s cash dividend (only) to $15 Raise the necessary $500,000 by issuing new equity M-M says: The stock price should be unchanged. 

![](images/lecture_11_intel_corporation_1992.en_img_6.jpg)

7 Example (cont.): • year. • • • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Since operations are unchanged, XYZ continues to generates $1M per Because the new shares are subject to the same risk as the old ones, they require the same rate of return: 10%. To raise $500,000, XYZ needs to promise new shareholders a $50,000 perpetuity since $50,000 / 10% = $500,000. After next year, the annual dividends accruing to old shareholders will be $1M -$50,000 = $950,000, a DPS of $9.5. Hence, next year’s price of old (and new) shares will be $95. QUESTION: What is today’s stock price under the alternative policy?

The value of the old shares is unaffected by the change in Changing the dividend policy is a zero NPV transaction. This is not surprising to you: It is a purely financial transaction. 1.1 

![](images/lecture_11_intel_corporation_1992.en_img_8.jpg)

9 Using this Result Sensibly • • →→→Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter The MM insight about dividend irrelevance helps us to avoid fallacies and illusions about payout policy. It also gets us to ask the right question: How does a change in payout policy affect the size of the pie? Different tax implications of different policies. Different policies may send different signals about the firm to outside investors. Some policies might constrain managers ability to waste funds on negative NPV projects. 

![](images/lecture_11_intel_corporation_1992.en_img_9.jpg)

10 Aside: The Bird-in-the-Hand Fallacy projects. •But note that not Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter This popular fallacy goes something like this: • A dividend today is safer than the promise of future payments. • Investors will pay a premium for dividend-paying firms. • Hence, dividends increase firm value. What is wrong with this argument? •Everything! A change in dividend policy does not change the size of the pie and hence does not affect value. •The popularity of this fallacy is based on the intuition that investors would rather receive the cash than have managers invest it into negative NPV any increase in value is really caused by a change in investment policy (foregone negative NPV projects) and by a change of dividend policy. •To see this, note that if managers paid the dividend but raised funds for the bad projects through new equity issues, no value would be created.

11 • →net →→• • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Dividends and Taxes In the US tax system, there is double taxation of cash dividends: At the corporate level, dividends are paid out of after-tax income. At the personal level, dividends are again taxed, this time as ordinary income. (Note: There is 70% tax exemption for companies receiving dividends.) This raises the following puzzles: Why pay dividends when interest payments are tax exempt? Why dividends when capital gains are taxed at a lower rate? If a firm really wants to pay out cash to shareholders, why as a dividend and not a share repurchase? 

![](images/lecture_11_intel_corporation_1992.en_img_11.jpg)

12 Puzzle 1: Dividends vs. Debt Interest • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Payments: Cash dividends and interest payments are taxed at the same rate at the investor level. BUT: Dividends are taxed at the corporate level, while interest payments are not. Thus, as a means of paying out cash to investors, interest payments seem to clearly dominate dividends. 

![](images/lecture_11_intel_corporation_1992.en_img_12.jpg)

13 Puzzle 2: Dividends vs. Capital Gains • • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Investors are taxed at a lower tax rate on capital gains compared to dividends. Moreover, because tax on capital gains is paid when the gain is realized, investors can delay the tax. Paying taxes later is “cheaper” because of the time value of money. Hence, cash dividends seem dominated by capital gains. Note: If a shareholder needs cash, she can sell a percentage of her shares equal to the dividend yield she desires. 

![](images/lecture_11_intel_corporation_1992.en_img_13.jpg)

14 Puzzle 3: Dividends vs. Stock Repurchase • • • dividends Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter At the personal level, the payment received in a share repurchase is taxed as capital gain (just as if the shareholder was selling his shares on the market to another investor). Thus, if a firm really wants to pay out cash to investors, cash dividends seem dominated by a share repurchase. Aside: If the IRS sees that share repurchases are regular and proportional to value, they will declare that the firm is really issuing dividends and charge the income tax rate. Despite this, more and more companies are using repurchases instead of

17 Bottom Line: • • →→Does this justify the tax burden? →• Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Cash dividends are expensive in terms of taxes. Every manager should ask herself: Why am I paying this dividend? Can I achieve the same with another method? Frankly, we still do not have much clever to say about why and how companies pay dividends.

18 • →→→• Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Some Explanations for Dividends beyond M-M: The Signaling Hypothesis: Firms can signal positive information through dividends. High quality firms can afford to pay dividends. Low quality firms cannot afford to mimic high quality firms. Therefore, by paying (or increasing) dividends, a firm can signal that it is a high quality firm. The logic is that “good” firms can undertake costly (=inefficient) actions to signal private information and separate from “bad” firms because “good” firms suffer less from the costs of these inefficient actions.

Excess cash can lead to agency problems  if managers are empire-Managers are reluctant to return excess cash to investors. May instead increase their sphere of influence (“Empire Building”) through May waste money on perks. Paying excess cash to investors makes managers run the firm more efficiently Dividends are a way to get money back to investors, preventing managers from wasting the money on negative NPV projects. Caveat: Dividends are discretionary. Using interest payments on debt to return excess cash is a much stronger commitment, since firms would go into default by missing interest payments. Nevertheless investors expect dividends to be continued, hence they are a stronger commitment to continuous payouts than repurchasing shares.

Cum-Dividend Date: Last day when shares are traded with the right to receive the dividend. (5 days before record date) Ex-Dividend Date: First day when shares are traded without the right to receive the dividend. (Day after the Cum-Dividend date) Shareholders are recorded to receive dividends. Payment Date: Dividend checks mailed out. On May 15, XYZ announces a 2nd quarter dividend of $0.20/share, with record date June 1, and payment date June 15. The cum dividend date is May 25, and ex-dividend date May 26.

22 Different Repurchase Methods 1 • market. • ¸ Example: • ¸ Example: Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Open market purchase: The firm buys its own shares on the Fixed price tender offer: The firm offers to buy up to a pre-specified number of shares at a pre-specified price during a pre-specified period of time. XYZ announces that it is going to buy up to 200,000 of its 5M shares of common stock at $28 per share. Note: If more than the maximum number of shares are tendered, shares are acquired on a pro-rata basis. If 100,000 shares are tendered to XYZ, it buys them all. If 400,000 shares are tendered, it buys half the shares tendered by each shareholder.

23 Different Repurchase Methods 2 • ¸ Example: →→→Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Dutch Auction: Each shareholder is invited to submit a bid price at which they are willing to tender (some of) their shares. The firm states the number of shares it buys during a pre-specified period of time, and sets a range of bids it accepts. The repurchase price is the lowest price necessary to acquire the number of shares sought. XYZ announces it will buy up to 200,000 of its 5M shares in a Dutch auction and invites shareholders to bid prices below $28. Suppose that: 50,000 shares were tendered at $25 150,000 shares were tendered at $26 80,000 shares were tendered at $27 Then XYZ buys at $26 all the shares tendered at or below $26.

24 • ¸ Example: • • ¸ Example:  Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Aside: Stock Dividends and Stock Splits Stock Dividend: Additional shares are sent to all shareholders. Every year, XYZ sends you 5 shares for every 100 shares you already hold. This is a 5% stock dividend. Stock Split: Each existing share is split into several shares. A stock dividend is similar to a stock split, but usually involves less shares. A two-for-one split is equivalent to a 100% stock dividend. Stock dividends are different from cash dividends: They do not result in cash exiting the firm. Hence they are not part of the payout policy. Do not be misled by the similarity of names.

Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter A key task of managers is to undertake valuation exercises in order to allocate capital between mutually exclusive projects: Is the project’s version A better than its modified version A’? The process of valuation and ultimately of capital budgeting generally involves many factors, some formal, some not (experience, hard-to-formalize information, politics, etc.).

Step 1: Estimate the Free Cash Flows. Step 2: Assess the risk of the free cash flows. Step 3: Account for the effect of financing on value. Preview of Step 3: Two ways to account for tax shield: Adjust the discount rate (WACC method). Adjust the cash flow estimate (APV method).

If project requires follow-on CAPX or additional working capital, take these into account. After-tax: The rest goes to the IRS. Be consistent in your treatment of inflation: Discount nominal cash flows at nominal discount rates. Nominal rates reflect inflation in overall economy, but inflation in cash flows may be different. In fact, some items in cash flows, e.g., depreciation, may have no inflation.

Remark 2: • Accounting measure of earnings are based on: Sales -Cost of Goods Sold • But: Income and expense are reported when a sale is declared. →COGS in 2000 includes the costs of items sold in 2000 even if the cost was incurred in 1999 or hasn’t been incurred yet. →Sales in 2000 include the income from items sold in 2000 even if the payment has not been received yet.

Typically, we start by estimating equity betas from a regression of equity returns on stock market returns. Problem: Sometimes we need to use the betas on “comparable” firms, either because there is insufficient data on the project available, or because we try to improve the precision of the estimate in that way. This “comparable firms” procedure for the estimation of asset betas is explained on the next slide.

Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Recognize that all firms that generate cash flow streams with the same risk will have the same asset beta. Identify firms that are likely to have cash flow streams that have similar risk. These are the “comparable” firms. Estimate asset betas for the comparable firms using the formula Estimate equity betas for each comparable firm by regressing Estimate debt betas for each comparable firm in the same manner. Usually, you won’t have data to do this. In practice, it is common to assume that debt is risk free (debt beta of zero), or to assume debt betas between 0.1 and 0.3, which come from empirical studies of corporate debt returns. We need to be more careful if leverage is high. Estimate the market value (D+E) of the firm as the sum of the market values of the debt and equity of the firm. If market value of debt (D) is not available, proxy with book value of debt.

Valuation

Free Cash Flows

![](images/lecture_13_valuation_of_free_cash_flows-b.en_img_0.jpg)

Katharina LewellenFinance Theory IIApril 2, 2003

Valuation Tools

- A key task of managers is to undertake valuation exercises in order to allocate capital between mutually exclusive projects:

- Is project A better than doing nothing?

- Is project A better than project B?

- Is the project’s version A than its modified version A’?

- The process of valuation and ultimately of capital budgeting generally involves many factors, some formal, some not (experience, hard-to-formalize information, politics, etc.).

- We will focus on financial tools for valuation.

Valuation Tools (cont.)

- These tools provide managers with numerical techniques to “keep score” and assist in the decision-making process.

- They build on modern finance theory and deal with cash flows, time, and risk.

- All rely on (often highly) simplified models of the business:

- Technical limitations (less now with computers)

- Versatility

- Understandable and discussible

How to Value a Project/Firm?

- Calculate NPV

- Estimate the expected cash-flows

- Estimate the appropriate discount rate for each cash flow

- Calculate NPV

- Look up the price of a comparable project

- Use alternative criteria (e.g., IRR, payback method)

- You need to be an educated user of these

Comparables method

- Suppose you want to value a private company going public

- EBITDA = $100 million

- For a similar public company P/E = 10

- You value the IPO company at $1,000 million

- What are the implicit assumptions?

- Suppose that P = E / (r –g)

- Then, P/E = 1 / (r –g)

- Thus, we assume that 

- Earnings are expected to grow in perpetuity at a constant rate

- Growth rates and discount rates are the same for both firms

Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

- One-period project

- Investment = 100 at time 0    Payoff = 150 at time 1

Rate of return = 150/100 –1 = 50%

NPV = -100 + 150/discount rate = 0

Discount rate =  150/100 = 50%

- Rate of return is the discount rate that makes NPV = 0

- Multiple period projects

- IRR is the discount rate that makes NPV = 0

Basic rule: Chose projects with IRR &gt; opportunity costs of capitBasic rule: Chose projects with IRR &gt; opportunity costs of capitalal

Internal Rate of Return (IRR), cont.

- Suppose you choose among two mutually exclusive projects

- E.g., alternative ways to use a particular piece of land

Project 1: cash flows-10 +20IRR=100%

Project 2: cash flows: -20 +35IRR=75%

- Which project would you choose? (costs of capital = 10%)

- Project 2 because it has a higher NPV

- Other pitfalls (BM, Chapter 5)

- E.g., multiple IRR, lending vs. borrowing.

- Bottom line

- NPV is easier to use than IRR

- If used properly, IRR should give you the same answer as NPV

1. Calculating Cash Flows

The Free Cash Flow (FCF) Approach

- FCF: The expected after tax cash flows of an all equity firm

- These cash flows ignore the tax savings the firm gets from debt financing (the deductibility of interest expense)

- Plan of Attack:

- Step 1: Estimating the Free Cash Flows

- Step 2: Account for the effect of financing on value

- Preview: Two ways to account for tax shield:

- Adjust the discount rate (WACC method).

- Adjust the cash-flow estimate (APV method).

Count allincremental, after-taxcash flows allowing for reasonable inflation.

- All:

- Don’t just look at operating profits in the out years.

- If project requires follow-on CAPX or additional working capital, take these into account.

- After-tax: The rest goes to the IRS.

- Be consistent in your treatment of inflation:

- Discount nominal cash flows at nominal discount rates.

- Reasons:

- Nominal rates reflect inflation in overall economy, but inflation in cash flows may be different.

- In fact, some items in cash flows, e.g., depreciation, may have no inflation.

Treatment of Inflation -Example

- T-Bill rate (nominal) = 8%

- Expected inflation rate = 6%

- Expected real rate = 1.08/1.06 = 1.9%

- Sales of widgets next year = $100 measured in today’s dollars

- You expect that the price of the widgets will go up by 6%

- What’s the PV of the widgets?

nominal cash flows:PV = $100*(1.06)/1.08 = 98.2

real cash flows:PV = $100/(1.08/1.06) = 98.2

Equivalent Expressions for Free Cash Flows (see Finance Theory I)

![](images/lecture_13_valuation_of_free_cash_flows-b.en_img_3.jpg)

Note:EBIT = Earnings before interest and taxesEBITD = Earnings before interest and taxes and depreciation = EBIT + DepreciationChange in NWC is sometimes called Investment in NWC.

Example of Free Cash Flow Calculation

EBIT = 1,200 -850 -35 = 315;  Ch. NWC = (60+60-25) -(50+50-20) = 15

FCF = 315 * (1-.38) + 35 -40 -15 = 175.3

Beware!

- Note:

- We ignored interest payments

- We computed taxes on EBIT

- Do not take the effect of financing (e.g., interest) into account at this stage.

- Remember our plan:

- First, determine the expected cash-flows as if the project were 100% equity financed.

- Later, we will adjust for financing.

- If you count financing costs in cash-flow, you count them twice.

TW Example

- XYZ, a profitable widget producer ($100M annual after-tax profit) contemplates introducing new Turbo Widgets (TWs), developed in its labs at an R&amp;D cost of $1M over the past 3 years.

- New plant to produce TW would

- cost $20M today

- last 10 years with salvage value of $5M

- be depreciated to $0 over 5 years using straight-line

- TWsneed painting: Use 40% of the capacity of a painting machine

- currently owned and used by XYZ at 30% capacity

- with maintenance costs of $100,000 (regardless of capacity used)

- Annual

- operating costs: $400,000

- operating income generated: $42M

- operating income of regular widgets would decrease by $2M

- Working capital (WC): $2M needed over the life of the project

- Corporate tax rate 36%

TW Example (cont.)

- Ignore the $100M after-tax profit and focus on incremental cash-flows

- R&amp;D cost of $1M over the past three years: Sunk cost ==&gt; Ignore it

- The plant’s $20M cost: It’s a CAPX ==&gt; Count it

- Machine’s $100K maintenance cost: Not incremental ==&gt; Ignore it

- Incurred with or without TW production

- True even if accounting charges TW production a fraction of these

- Op. income of regular widgets decrease by $2M due to cannibalization

- Would not occur without TW production

- It is an opportunity cost ==&gt; Count it

Use Incremental Cash Flows

- Compare firm value with and without the project

V(project) = V(firm w/ project)  -V(firm w/o project) 

- Use only cash flows (in and out) attributable to the project

- Sunk costsshould be ignored

- They are spent w/ or w/o the project (bygones are bygones).

- Opportunity costsshould be accounted for

- A project might exclude good alternatives (e.g., use of land).

- Accounting illusions should be avoided

- e.g. the project might be “charged” for a fraction of expenses that would be incurred anyway.

Use After-tax Cash Flows

- These are what you have left after paying capital suppliers

- Make sure to count the benefits of expensing, depreciation, etc.

- CAPX and Depreciation:

- CAPX are not directly subtracted from taxable income

- Instead, a fraction of CAPX (depreciation) is subtracted over a number of years

TW Example (cont.)

- Depreciation:

- Straight line depreciation: Flat annual depreciation

- Accelerated depreciation: Decreasing

- $20M CAPX is depreciated linearly over 5 years, down to zero.

D = (20 -0) / 5 = $4M

- Salvage value $5M is fully taxable since book value is zero.

So far (but we’re not done yet):

Example:We could have computed the CF in year 1 as

(1 -36%) * 39.6  + 36% *  4  -0 = $26.8M

CF = Incr. Profit –Taxes –CAPX

= Incr. Profit –t * (Incr. Profit –Depr.) –CAPX

= (1 –t) * Incr. Profit + t * Depr. –CAPX

Changes in (Net) Working Capital

Remark 1:

- Many projects need some capital to be tied up (working capital) which constitutes an opportunity cost.

- We need the Change in Working Capital implied by the project.

Remark 2:

- Accounting measure of earnings

Sales -Cost of Goods Sold

- Income and expense are reported when a sale is declared.

- COGS in 2000 includes the costs of items sold in 2000 even if the cost was incurred in 1999 or hasn’t been incurred yet.

- Sales in 2000 include the income from items sold in 2000 even ifthe payment has not been received yet.

Working Capital = Inventory + A/R -A/P

Finding the Value of the Cash Flows

- We need to find the appropriate discount ratefor a project

- We need to account for the tax benefits of interest payments

- Ignore this for now, and assume that the project is 100% equity financed

Decision RuleAccept any project with positive NPV.  The NPV tells you how much value the project creates.

What is the appropriate discount rate for a project?

- The discount rate is the opportunity cost of capitalfor the project.

- It answers the question:  What rate can investors earn on an investments with comparable risk?

- What does comparable risk mean?

Using the CAPM

- What does ‘comparable risk’ mean?

- CAPM:  risk = β

- How does risk translate into a discount rate?

- CAPM:  E[rE] = rf+ βEE[RM–rf]

Estimating Betas

- Equity Beta

- Simply regress past stock returns on the market return

- Asset Beta

- For an all-equity firm, equity beta = asset beta

- How about levered firms?

- Hint:

- You can view the firm as a portfolio of debt and equity

- Recall: portfolio beta = weighted average of individual asset betas

- Question: What are the appropriate weights?

- You can assume that debt is risk-free or that debt beta is between 0.1 and 0.3 (based on empirical studies)

7 WARNING!!! • →→This intuition is wrong. • • →→Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter The common intuition for using WACC is: “To be valuable, a project should return more than what it costs us to raise the necessary financing, i.e., our WACC” Using WACC this way is OK sometimes... but “by accident”.

Cost of Capital

Finance Theory II

April 9, 2003

What Next?

- We want to value a project that is financed by both debt and equity

- Our approach:

- Calculate expected Free Cash Flows(FCFs) from the project

- Discount FCFs at a rate that reflects opportunity costs of capital of all capital suppliers

- Incorporate the interest tax shields

- Adjust the discount rate (WACC)

- Adjust cash flows (APV)

![](images/lecture_15_wacc_and_apv_1-b.en_img_0.jpg)

Recall: Recall: Free Cash Flowsare cash flows available to be paid to all capital suppliers ignoring interest rate tax shields (i.e., as if the project were 100% equity financed).

Two Approaches

- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):

- Discount the FCF using the weighted average of after-tax debt costs and equity costs

- Adjusted Present Value (APV):

- Value the project as if it were all-equity financed

- Add the PV of the tax shieldof debt and other side effects

WACC -Example

You are evaluating a new project.  The project requires an initial outlay of $100 million and you forecast before-tax profits of $25 million in perpetuity.  The tax rate is 40%, the firm has a target debt-to-value ratio of 25%, the interest rate on the firm’s debt is 7%, and the cost of equity is 12%.

After-tax CFs = $25 ×0.60 = $15 million

After-tax WACC= D/V (1–τ) rd+  E/V re

= 0.25 ×0.60 ×0.07  +  0.75 ×0.12 = 10.05%

NPV = -100 + 15 / 0.1005 = $49.25 million

WARNING!!!

- The common intuition for using WACC is:

- “To be valuable, a project should return more than what it costsus to raise the necessary financing, i.e., our WACC”

- This intuition is wrong.

- Using WACC this way is OK sometimes... but “by accident”.

- Sometimes, this is plain wrong:

- conceptually, i.e., the logic may be flawed

- practically, i.e., gives you a result far off the mark

- Need to understand this concept (more tricky than it appears).

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

- Recall: Discount rates are project-specific==&gt; Imagine the project is a stand alone, i.e., financed as a separate firm.

- Debt worth D (i.e. market value) and with expected return kD(i.e., cost of debt) if against that project only

- Equity worth E (i.e. market value) and with expected return kE(i.e., cost of equity) if against that project only

- t is the marginal tax rate of the firm undertaking the project

Why WACC?

- Consider a one-year project (stand-alone) such that:

- expected cash-flow at the end of year 1 (BIT) = X

- Today (year 0) the projects has:

- debt outstanding with market value D0

- equity outstanding with market value E0

- project’s total value is V0 = D0 +E0

- We are looking for the discount rate r such that:

Leverage Ratio D/(D+E)

- D/(D+E) should be the target capital structure (in market values)  for the particular project under consideration.

- Common mistake 1:

- Using a priori D/(D+E) of the firm undertaking the project.

- Common mistake 2:

- Use D/(D+E) of the project’s financing

- Example: Using 100% if project is all debt financed.

Caveat: We will assume that the target for A+B is the result of combining target for A and target for B. It’s OK most of the time.

Leverage Ratio (cont.)

- So how do we get that ratio?

- Comparables to the project:

- “Pure plays” in the same business as the project

- Trade-off: Number vs. “quality” of comps

- The firm undertaking the project if the project is very much like the rest of the firm (i.e., if the firm is a comp for the project).

- Introspection, improved by checklist,...

Important Remark

- If the project maintains a relatively stable D/V over time, thenWACC is also stable over time.

- If not, then WACC should vary over time as well so you should compute/forecast a different WACC for each year.

- In practice, firms tend to use a constant WACC.

- So, in practice, WACC method is not great when capital structure is expected to vary substantially over time.

Cost of Debt Capital: kD

- When default probability is low

- We can estimate kDusing CAPM (empirical evidence suggests using debt betas between 0.2 and 0.3)

- kDshould be close to the interest rate that lenders would charge to finance the project with the chosen capital structure

- When default probability is high

- We would need default probabilities to estimate expected cash flows to debtholders

Marginal Tax Rate: t

- It’s the marginal tax rate of the firm undertaking the project (or to be more precise, of the firm + project).

- Indeed, this is the rate that is going to determine the tax savings associated with debt.

- Marginal as opposed to average tax rate t

Cost of Equity Capital: kE

- Need to estimate kEfrom comparables to the project:

- “Pure Plays”, i.e. firms operating only in the project’s industry

- The firm undertaking the project (if the firm is a pure play)

- Problem:

- A firm’s capital structure has an impact on kE

- Unless we have comparables with same capital structure, we need to work on their kEbefore using it.

Using CAPM to Estimate kE

1) Finds comps for the project under consideration.

2) Unlevereach comp’s βE(using the comp’sD/(D+E)) to estimate its βA: 

3) Use the comps’ βA to estimate the project’s βA(e.g. take the average).

4) Releverthe project’s estimated βA (using the project’s D/(D+E)) to estimate its βEunder the assumed capital structure:

5) Use the estimated βE to calculate the project’s cost of equity kE:

kE= rf  + βE* Market Risk Premium

Remarks

- Formulas:

- Relevering formulas are reversed unlevering formulas.

- The appendix shows where they come from.

- Most of the time:

- Unlever each comp, i.e., one unlevering per comp.

- Estimate one βAby taking the average over all comps’ βApossibly putting more weight on those we like best.

- This is our estimate of the project’s βA

- Relever that βAonly, i.e., just one relevering.

- In the course, we use mostly the formula for a constant D/V.

More on Business Risk and Financial Risk

- Comparable firms have similar Business Risk

- Similar asset beta βAand, consequently, similar unlevered cost of capital kA

- Comparable firms can have different Financial Risk(βE-βA) if they have different capital structures 

- Different equity beta βEand thus different required return on equity kE

- In general, equity beta βEincreases with D/E

- Consequently the cost of equity kE  increases with leverage

Leverage, returns, and risk 

Asset risk is determined by the type of projects, not how the projects are financed

Business Risk and Financial Risk: Intuition

- Consider a project with βA&gt;0

- Its cash flows can be decomposed into:

- Safe cash-flows

- Risky cash-flows that are positively correlated with the market.

- As the level of debt increases (but remains relatively safe):

- A larger part of the safe cash-flows goes to debtholders;

- The residual left to equityholders is increasingly correlated with the market.

Note:If cash-flows were negatively correlated with the market (βA&lt;0), increasing debt would make equity more negatively correlated with the market and would reduce the required return on equity.

General Electric’s WACC

- Assume  rf = 6%

- We can get GE’s βE=1.10 which implies

kE= 6% + 1.10 * 8% = 14.8%

- kD = 7.5%

- D/(D+E) = .06

- t = 35%

WACC = .06 * 7.5% * (1-35%) + .094 * 14.8%  =  14.2%

When Can GE Use This WACC in DCF?

- When the project under consideration has the same basic risk as the rest of the company (i.e., when the company is a good comp for its project).

- And, the project will be financed in the same way as the rest of the company.

- For example, if GE is expanding the scale of entire operations then it should use its own WACC.

- But, if planning to expand in only one of its many different businesses then it’s not the right cost of capital.

- In that case: Find publicly-traded comps and do unlevering / levering.

Important Warning

- Cost of capital is an attribute of an investment, notthe company

- Few companies have a single WACC that they can use for all of their businesses.

GE’s businesses:

- Financial services

- Power systems

- Aircraft engines

- Industrial

- Engineered plastics

- Technical products

- Appliances

- Broadcasting

How Firms Tend to Use WACC

They calculate their WACC using:

- Their current cost of debt kD

- Their own current capital structure D/(D+E)

- Their own current cost of equity capital kE(more on this soon).

- The marginal tax rate they are facing

They discount all future FCF with:

- this (single) discount rate

- maybe adjusted for other things (e.g., project’s “strategic value”)

The WACC Fallacy (Revisited)

- The cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity (true).

- Does this mean that projects should be financed with debt?

- No: WACC is independent of leverage

- As you are tapping into cheap debt, you are increasing the cost of equity (its financial risk increases).

2. APV

Adjusted Present Value

- Separates the effects of financial structure from the others.

- Step 1: Value the project/firm as if it were 100% equity financed.

- Step 2: Add the value of the tax shield of debt.

Note:

- This is simply applying MM-Theorem with taxes

- APV = Valuation by Components = ANPV

Step 1: Value if 100% Equity Financed

- Cash-flows: Free Cash Flows are exactly what you need.

- You need the rate that would be appropriate to discount the firm’s cash flows if the firm were 100% equity financed.

- This rate is the expected return on equity if the firm were 100%equity financed.

- To get it, you need to:

- Find comps, i.e., publicly traded firms in same business.

- Estimate their expected return on equity if they were 100% equity financed.

Step1: Value if 100% Equity Financed (cont.)

- Unlever each comp’s βEto estimate its asset beta (or all equity or unleveredbeta) βA using the appropriate unlevering formula

- Use the comps’ βA to estimate the project’s βA(e.g. average).

- Use the estimated βA to calculate the all-equity cost of capital kA 

kA= rf  + βA* Market Risk Premium

- Use kAto discount the project’s FCF

![](images/lecture_15_wacc_and_apv_1-b.en_img_22.jpg)

Example

- Johnson and Johnson operate in several lines of business: Pharmaceuticals, consumer products and medical devices.

- To estimate the all-equity cost of capital for the medical devices division, we need a comparable, i.e., a pure play in medical devices (we should really have several).

- Data for Boston Scientific:

- Equity beta = 0.98

- Debt = $1.3b

- Equity = $9.1b.

Example (cont.)

- Compute Boston Scientific’s asset beta:

- Let this be our estimate of the asset beta for the medical devices business

- Use CAPM to calculate the all-equity cost of capital for that business (assuming 6% risk-free rate, 8% market risk premium):

kA= 6% + .86 *8% = 12.9%

Step 2: Add PV(Tax Shield of Debt)

- Cash-flow: The expected tax saving is tkDD where kDis the cost of debt capital (discussed earlier).

- If D is expected to remain stable, then discount tkDD using kD 

PVTS = tkDD/ kD= tD

- If D/V is expected to remain stable, then discount tkDD using kA

PVTS = tkDD/ kA

- Intuition:

- If D/V is constant, D (tkDD) moves up/down with V

- The risk of tkDD is similar to that of the firm’s assets: use kA

Step 2: Add PVTS (cont.)

- For many projects, neither D nor D/V is expected to be stable.

- For instance, LBO debt levels are expected to decline.

- In general you can estimate debt levels using:

- repayment schedule if one is available,

- financial forecasting

and discount by a rate between  kDand  kA.

Extending the APV Method

- One good feature of the APV method is that it is easy to extend to take other effects of financing into account.

- For instance, one can value an interest rate subsidy separately as the PV of interest savings.

APV= NPV(all-equity) + PV(Tax Shield) + PV(other stuff)

WACC vs. APV

Pros of WACC: Most widely used

- Less computations needed (before computers).

- More literal, easier to understand and explain (?)

Cons of WACC:

- Mixes up effects of assets and liabilities. Errors/approximations in effect of liabilities contaminate the whole valuation.

- Not very flexible:What if debt is risky? Cost of hybrid securities (e.g., convertibles)? Other effects of financing (e.g., costs of distress)? Non-constant debt ratios?

Note: For non-constant debt ratios, could use different WACC for each year (see appendix) but this is heavy and defeats the purpose.

WACC vs. APV (cont.)

Advantages of APV:

- No contamination.

- Clearer: Easier to track down where value comes from.

- More flexible: Just add other effects as separate terms. 

Cons of APV:

- Almost nobody uses it.

Overall:

- For complex, changing or highly leveraged capital structure (e.g., LBO), APV is much better.

- Otherwise, it doesn’t matter much which method you use.

Appendix

Appendix A: Unlevering Formula for a Constant Debt Ratio D/V

- Consider a firm with perpetual expected cash-flows, X.

- Capital structure: Debt worth D and equity worth E

- By definition, the all-equity cost of capital is the rate kA that is appropriate for discounting the project’s FCF, (1-t)X.

- Moreover, since the firm’s D/V is stable, PVTS= tDkD/ kA

Appendix C: WACC vs. APV: Example

Objective of the example:

- See APV and WACC in action.

- Show that, when correctly implemented, APV and WACC give identical results.

- Correctly implementing WACC in an environment of changing leverage.

- Convince you that APV is the way to go.

WACC vs. APV: Example (cont.)

AnttozInc., a Fortune 500 widget company, is planning to set up a newfactory in New Orleans with cash flows as presented on the next slide:

- The new plant will require an initial investment in PPE of $75 million, plus an infusion of $10 million of working capital (equal to 8% of first-year sales).

- Sales are projected to be $125 million in the first year of operation. Sales are projected to rise a whopping 10% over the next two years, with growth stabilizing at a 5% rate indefinitely thereafter.

- Anttoz’sarmy of financial analysts estimate that cash costs (COGS, GS&amp;Aexpenses, etc.) will constitute 50% of revenues.

- New investment in PPE will match depreciation each year, starting at 10% of the initial $75 million investment and growing in tandem with sales thereafter.

- The firm plans to maintain working capital at 8% of the following year’s projected sales.

WACC vs. APV: Example (cont.)

- With AnttozWidgets Inc. in the 35% tax bracket, FCF would approach $45 million in three years, and grow 5% per year thereafter.

- The required rate of return on the project’s assets, kA, is 20%.

- The project supports a bank loan of $80 million initially with $5 million principal repayments at the end of the first three years of operation, bringing debt outstanding at the end of the third year to $65 million.

- From that point on, the project’s debt capacity will increase by5% per year, in line with the expected growth of operating cash flows. Because of the firm’s highly leveraged position in the early years, the borrowing rate is 10% initially, falling to 8% once it achieves a stable capital structure (after year 3).

Managers have many options to adapt and revise decisions in response to new and unexpected developments. Such flexibility is clearly valuable and should be accounted for in the valuation of a project or firm. Often, managers can expand or contract production in response to changes in demand. The firm would be less valuable if they had to choose a fixed production level before knowing the level of demand.

13 Abandonment Options: • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter The Option to Shut-down An investment includes an abandonment option if, under certain circumstances, it may be preferable to shut down current operations permanently and realize the resale value of capital equipment and other assets in secondhand markets. Sometimes, abandonment options are hidden in aggregated forecasts: While it may be preferable to continue operations on average, shutting down may be better under some scenarios. Abandonment options are akin to Put options: You have the option (but no obligation) to get rid of something and receive a payment (the liquidation value).

14 Option to Expand or Contract Scale • utilization. • • →→Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter If conditions are more favorable than expected, the firm can expand the scale of production or accelerate resource If conditions are less favorable than expected, the firm can contract the scale of operations. In extreme cases, production can temporarily halt and start again. Similar to growth and abandonment options. •Examples: Ability to slow the rate of mineral extraction from a mine. Ability to add a temporary third shift at a factory.

15 Timing Options: Option to accelerate or decelerate projects • • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Retaining some flexibility about the timing of an investment (possibly including “never”) can be very valuable. Example: A patent’s value should account for the timing option, i.e., when buying the patent, you are buying the right to use it whenever you want (during the patent’s lifetime). Akin to an American call option: You have the option (but not the obligation) to get something at any time by paying a cost. Note: Only those investment timing problems for which relevant information is likely to arrive involve “option value”.

16 • • • →→→Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Time to Build Options (Staged Investment) Staging investment as a series of outlays creates the option to abandon the enterprise in midstream if new information is unfavorable. Each stage can be viewed as a call option on the value of subsequent stages, and valued as a compound option. Important in: all R&amp;D intensive industries, especially pharmaceuticals; long-development capital-intensive projects, e.g., large-scale construction or energy-generating plants; start-up ventures.

<TH>Category Description Important in: Option to Defer Management has opportunity to wait to invest, and can see if markets warrant further investment. Natural resources extraction, real estate, farming, technology. Staged Investment Staging investment creates the option to reevaluate and/or abandon at each stage. R&amp;D intensive industries, energy generation, start-up ventures. Option to alter operating scale If market conditions change, the firm can expand/contract or temporarily shut down. Natural resources, fashion, real estate, consumer goods. Option to abandon If market conditions decline, management sells off assets Capital-intensive industries, new product introductions in uncertain markets. Option to switch If prices or demand change, management can change product mix (product flexibility) or switch inputs (process flexibility) Companies in volatile markets with shifting preferences, energy companies Growth options An early investment opens up future growth opportunities in the form of new products or processes, access to markets, or strengthening of core capabilities High tech; industries with multiple product generations (drug companies, computers, strategic acquisitions). Multiple Interacting Options Projects involve a collection of various options—both put and call types.  Values can differ from the sum of separate option values because they interact.

Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Real projects, especially long-horizon ones, are complex: They often combine assets-in-place and options. Options are often nested. Simplifying assumptions are needed: To allow the technical valuation analysis. To keep the model flexible. To keep the model understandable to you and others

20 Practical Issue: Simplifications (cont.) • • • →Examples: • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter What should you do? Cut the project into pieces corresponding to simple options. Search for the primary uncertainty that managers face. A simplified model that dominates (is dominated by) the project gives an upper (a lower) bound for the project’s value. Using European rather than American options. Ignoring some of the options. Ignoring some adverse effects of waiting (e.g. possible entry).

Assume all other options are “negligible”. Assume that phase 2 is to be undertaken in 2003 or never. Value as a European Call option. Make simplifying assumptions about the distribution of the project’s value.

23 Valuation of Real Options • →• →• Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter The tools developed to value financial options (i.e. calls and puts on stocks and other financial assets) can be useful to estimate the value of real options embedded in some projects. Black-Scholes is often used to value real options. PROBLEM: Real options are much more complex than financial options. Need to simplify them to fit them into the valuation models for financial options. Similar to DCF analysis, the aim is to develop numerical techniques to “keep score” and assist in the decision-making process, not to replace sound business sense.

The strategy is to map the embedded option in our proect into a simple financial option and use financial valuation tools to price the option: Black-Scholes formula. Oftentimes, this involves making somewhat heroic assumptions about the project!

Finance Theory II

April 28, 2003

Real options

- Managers have many options to adapt and revise decisions in response to unexpected developments.

- Such flexibility is clearly valuable and should be accounted forin the valuation of a project or firm.

Real options, cont.

Imbedded options

- Follow-up investments

- Option to abandon the project

- Option to wait before investing

- Option to expand / change production methods

Key elements

- Information will arrive in the future

- Decisions can be made after receiving this information

Our plan

Last class

- Real options: basic intuition

- Simple DCF analysis of real options (decision trees)

Today

- Review of option pricing

- Why doesn’t simple DCF work quite well?

- Identifying real options

- Valuing real options using Black Scholes

1. Review of option pricing

Real options and financial options

![](images/lecture_17_real_options-b.en_img_0.jpg)

Option Definition  The right (but not the obligation), to buy/sell an underlying asset at a price (the exercise price) that may be different than the market price.   Financial Options          Vs.           Real Options:   Options on stocks, stock indices, foreign exchange,gold, silver, wheat, etc.   Not traded on exchange. Underlying asset is something other than a security

![](images/lecture_17_real_options-b.en_img_2.jpg)

Pricing of a call option on stock

- Consider the following strategy:

- Borrow money (or sell a bond with face value of B)

- Buy a N shares of stock

- Choose N and B so that the payoffs from the portfolio = option payoffs

?

10 = -B + N*120

0 = -B + N*80

B = 20

N = 0.25

![](images/lecture_17_real_options-b.en_img_4.jpg)

Pricing of a call option on stock

- Our stock / bond portfolio has exactly the same payoffas the option

- So, the option and the portfolio must have the same value today

- Otherwise: arbitrage opportunity

- What is the value of the portfolio today (assume risk-free rate =4%)?

-B / (1+r) + N * S0=      -20 / 1.04 + 0.25 * 100      =     5.77

- We just priced the option.  Option value = $5.77.

Why standard DCF doesn’t work very well?

- Let’s value our option using standard DCF

- What discount rate should we use?

- Let’s try the required return on stock E[RS]

S0= 100

S1= 120

S1= 80

E[S1] = 112   =&gt;   E[RS] = 12%

![](images/lecture_17_real_options-b.en_img_5.jpg)

p = 0.8

![](images/lecture_17_real_options-b.en_img_6.jpg)

p = 0.2

Why standard DCF doesn’t work very well?

- DCF gives us the following option value:

(0.8 * 10 + 0.2 * 0) / 1.12 = $7.14   ≠$5.77

What’s wrong?

- Discount rate of 12% is too low =&gt; the option is riskier than the underlying stock

Why?

- Option is a levered position in a stock. 

- Recall the analogy with firms’ financial leverage: Higher financial leverage =&gt; higher equity betas and equity returns.

Option is a levered position in a stock

- Recall our replicating portfolio: Borrow B/(1+r) and buy N shares of stock

- Suppose that stock beta = 1 and market premium = 8%

- Note that this works.  CAPM: 12% = 4% + 1 * 8%

- What is option beta?

βoption= wbond* βbond+ wstock* βstock=  4.33

0         25/5.77 * 1

![](images/lecture_17_real_options-b.en_img_7.jpg)

So, the required return on the option is 38% = 4% + 4.33 * 8%And the option value is again:  $5.77 = 8 / 1.38

How about multiple periods?

T=0T=1T=2

- In principle, we can value the option the same way as before

- Start at time T=2 and move backwards

- But several things change at each node:

- Replicating portfolio, option beta, discount rate

![](images/lecture_17_real_options-b.en_img_9.jpg)

This can become quite tediousThat’s where option pricing models such as Black-Scholescome in.

Options valuation techniques

- “Dynamic” DCF (decision trees)

- Recall our “Handheld PC” and “Copper Mine” examples

- Approximationused for real-options problems

- Not an exact answer because of problems with discounting

- Binomial model

- Similar to our one-period example from today’s class

- Requires more computations than Black-Scholes

- Can be useful when Black-Scholesdoesn’t work very well

- Black-Scholes

- We will focus on this model from now on

Black-Scholesformula

- Black-Scholesformula relies on the same valuation principles as the binomial model (replicating portfolios, no arbitrage)

Option value = N(d1) * S –N(d2) * PV(X)

- Note the similarities to the one-period binomial model

Option value = N * S –PV(B)

![](images/lecture_17_real_options-b.en_img_10.jpg)

N(d): Cumulative normal probability density functiond1= ln[S/PV(X)] / (σT1/2) + (σT1/2)/2d2= d1-(σT1/2)S = Current stock priceX = Exercise pricer = Risk-free interest rateT = Time to maturity in years.σ= Standard deviation of stock return

2. Identifying Real Options

Two Issues with Real Options

Identification

- Are there real options imbedded in this project?

- What type of options?

Valuation

- How do we value options?

- How do we value different types of options?

- Can’t we just use NPV?

Identifying Real Options

- It is important to identify the options imbedded in a project. 

- There are options imbedded in all but the most trivial projects.

- All the art consists in:

- Identifying those that are “significant”, if any

- Ignoring those that are not

- Identifying real options takes practice, and sometimes “vision”.

Identifying Real Options (cont.)

- Look for clues in the project’s description: “Phases”, “Strategic investment”, “Scenarios”, …

- Examine the pattern of cash flows and expenditures over time. For instance, large expenditures are likely to be discretionary.

- Taxonomy of frequently encountered options :

- Growth option

- Abandonment option

- Option to expand or contract scale

- Timing

- Option to switch (inputs, outputs, processes, etc.)

Is There An Option?

- Two conditions:

(1) News will possibly arrive in the future;

(2) When it arrives, the news may affect decisions.

- Search for the uncertainty that managers face:

- What is the main thing that managers will learn over time?

- How will they exploit that information?

Oz Toys’ Expansion Program

- Oz Toys’ management is considering building a new plant to exploit innovations in process technology.

- About three years out, the plant’s capacity may be expanded to allow Oz Toys’ entry into two new markets.

Oz Toys: Is There An Option?

(1) Oz Toys might learn (or not) about:

- The demand for the current and/or new products

- The possibility of rivals entering the market

- Etc.

(2) The information might affect (or not) Oz Toys’ decision:

- Whether or not to undertake expansion phase 1 at all

- Whether to undertake phase 2 (or even phase 3,…)

- Whether to push one new product or the other

- Etc.

Oz Toys: Identifying the Option

- Project’s description refers to two distinct phases

- Phase 1: New plant

- Phase 2: Expansion

- Spike in spending: Probably discretionary

- Possibly, an imbedded growth option

Practical Issue #1: Simplifications

- Real projects, especially long-horizon ones, are complex:

- They often combine assets-in-place and options.

- Options are nested.

- Simplifying assumptions are needed:

- To allow the technical valuation analysis

- To keep the model flexible

- To keep the model understandable to you and others (especially others involved in the decision process)

Practical Issue #1: Simplifications (cont.)

- Cut the project into pieces corresponding to simple options.

- Search for the primaryuncertainty that managers face

- A simplified model that dominates (is dominated) by the project gives an upper (a lower) bound for the project’s value, e.g.,:

- Using European rather than American options

- Ignoring some of the options

- Ignoring some adverse effects of waiting (e.g. possible entry)

Oz Toys: Simplifications

- Value phase 1 and phase 2 separately.

- Focus on the option to undertake expansion phase 2 or not.

- Assume all other options are “negligible”

- Assume that phase 2 is to be undertaken in 2003 or never.

European Call option

3. Valuing Real Options

Valuation of Real Options

- Tools developed to value financial options can be useful to estimate the value of real options embedded in some projects.

- Real options are much more complex than financial options. 

- The aim here is to develop numerical techniques to “keep score” and assist in the decision-making process, not provide a recipe to replace sound business sense.

Options vs. DCF

- The real options approach is often presented as an alternative to DCF.

- In fact, the real options’ approach does not contradict DCF: It is a particular form that DCF takes for certain types of investments.

- Recall that option valuation techniques were developed because discounting is difficult

- I.e., due to the option, one should not use the same discount rate (e.g. WACC) for all cash flows.

Options vs. DCF (cont.)

- DCF method:

- “expected scenario” of cash flows,

- discount the expected cash flows

- This is perfectly fine as long as:

- expected cash flows are estimated properly

- discount rates are estimated properly

- Precisely, it is complex to account for options in estimating:

- expected cash flow

- discount rates

Start with the “static” DCF Analysis

- Begin by valuing the project as if there was no option involved

- Pretend that the investment decision must be takenimmediately.

- This benchmark constitute a lower boundfor the project’s value.

- NPV&lt;0 does not mean that you will never want to undertake the investment.

- NPV&gt;0 does not mean that you should go ahead immediately with the invest (nor that you will definitely invest in the future).

Oz Toys: DCF Analysis

- Disentangling the two phases.

- Requires making judgments about:

- Which expenses are discretionary vs. non-discretionary

- Which cash inflows/outflows are associated with each phase

- Note: Sometimes, simply retrieve disaggregated data used to construct the summary DCF analysis.

Oz Toys: DCF Analysis (cont.)

- Both phases have negative NPV

- Phase 2’s NPV is probably largely overstated:

- Investment ($382M) is likely to be less risky than cash flows.

- Using the three-year risk-free rate of 5.5%

Valuing the Option

- The strategy is to map the project into a simple option and use financial valuation tools to price the option: Black-Scholesformula.

- Oftentimes, this involves making somewhat heroic assumptions about the project.

Practical Issue #2: What Volatility?

- Volatility (σ) cannot be looked up in a table or newspaper.

- Note: Even a rough estimate of σcan be useful, e.g., to decide whether to even bother considering the option value.

1. Take an informed guess:

- Systematic and total risks are correlated: High βprojects tend to have a higher σ.

- The volatility of a diversified portfolio within that class of assets is a lower bound.

- 20-30% per year is not remarkably high for a single project.

Practical Issue #2: What Volatility? (cont.)

2. Data:

- For some industries, historical data on investment returns.

- Implied volatilities can be computed from quoted option prices for many traded stocks

- Note: These data need adjustment because equity returns being levered, they are more volatile than the underlying assets.

Practical Issue #2: What Volatility? (cont.)

3. Simulation:

- Step 1: Build a spread-sheet based (simplified) model of the project’s future cash flows

- Model how CFs depend on specific items (e.g. commodity prices, interest and exchange rates, etc.)

- Step 2: Use Monte Carlo simulation to simulate a probability distribution for the project’s returns and infer σ.

Black-ScholesFormula

- Two numbers suffice:

- A table that gives the Black-Scholes’ call option value as a fraction of the stock price S (see handout)

Black-ScholesFormula (cont.)

- The number A captures phase 2’s value if the decisioncould not be delayed (but investment and cash flows still began in 2003).

- Indeed, in that case, A would be phase 2’s Profitability Index:

- The option’s value increases with A (as shown in the table).

0NPV  1 AandA   r)(1XSPV(inv.) PV(cf)PIT&gt;⇔&gt;=⎟⎟⎠⎞⎜⎜⎝⎛+==

Black-ScholesFormula (cont.)

- The number B, Cumulative Volatility, is a measure of “how much S can change” between now and the decision time T.

- Intuitively, S can change more:

- when S has more variance per year, i.e., σis large

- when there is more time for S to change, i.e., T is large

- B captures the value of being able to delay the decision.

Note:When B=0, only the project’s NPV matters (whether A&gt;1) because either the decision has to be taken now (T=0) or it might just as well be taken now as no news will arrive (σ=0).

Oz Toys: Valuation

- The value of phase 2 is (roughly): V2= 19% * S = .19 * 255.8 = $48.6M

- The value of the expansion program is: V1 + V2= -3.7 + 48.6 = $44.9M

Practical Issue #3: Checking the Model

- Formal option pricing models make distributional assumptions.

- Approach 1: Try and find a model that is close to your idea of the real distribution (More and more are available).

- Approach 2: Determine the direction in which the model biases the analysis, and use the result as an upper or lower bound.

- Approach 3: Simulate the project as a complex decision tree and solve by brute force with a computer (i.e., not analytically).

Practical Issue #4: Interpretation

- Since we use simplified models, the results need to be taken with a grain of salt and interpreted.

- Put complexity back into the model with:

- Sensitivity analysis

- Conditioning and qualifying of inferences

- Iterative process.

- Helps you identify the main levers of the project, and where youneed to gather more data or fine tune the analysis.

For transactions, can also use multiples for comparable transactions (e.g. similar takeovers). Multiples based on equity value (or stock price, e.g., P/E) as opposed to total firm value ignore effect of leverage on the cost of equity (or assume the firms have similar leverage) =&gt; Beware if comps have very different leverage.

19 Comparables: Pros and Cons Pros: • • • • Cons: • • • measures. • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Incorporates a lot of information from other valuations in a simple way. Embodies market consensus about discount rate and growth rate. Free-ride on market’s information. Can provide discipline in valuation process by ensuring that your valuation is in line with other valuations. Implicitly assumes all companies are alike in growth rates, cost of capital, and business composition. Hard to find true comps. Hard time incorporating firm specific information. Particularly problematic if operating changes are going to be implemented. Accounting differences, particularly with earnings and equity-based Multiples of FCF and EBITDA preferable for this reason. Book values can vary across firms depending on age of PPE. If everyone uses comps, who actually does fundamental analysis?

Finance Theory II

May 5, 2003

Valuing companies

- Familiar valuation methods

- Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

- Comparables

- Real Options

- Some new issues

- Do we value assets or equity?

- Terminal values (liquidation, going concern)

- Minority interests, controlling interests

DCF Analysis

- WACC method:

- Forecast expected FCF

- Estimate WACC

- Compute PV

- APV method:

- Forecast expected FCF

- Estimate kA

- Compute PV

- Add PV(Tax Shield)

Value Assets or Equity?

- DCF methods give you the value of the whole firm (D + E) or Enterprise Value.

- E.g., you are founding a new firm: you will receive D from creditors and E from shareholders.

- Often, you need to value the Equity Valuein an existing firm 

- E.g., M&amp;A, IPOs

- You need to subtract the value of its existing debt D

- Also, need to add the value of control when valuing a controlling equity position (more on this later).

Terminal Values

- In valuing long-lived projects or ongoing businesses, we don’t typically forecast every year of cash flow forever.

- Forecast FCF until it is reasonable (or best guess) to think that the project or company is in “steady state.”

- Typically, assume:

- either the company is liquidated;

- or FCF is a growing, flat, or declining, perpetuity;

- Note: The forecast horizon will depend on firm and industry.

Terminal Value in Liquidation

1) Salvage value (SV):

- CF that the firm receives from liquidating its assets

SV = Liquidation price -Liquidation costs

- The firm is taxed on (SV –PPE) so that overall it gets

SV*(1-t)  + t*PPE

2) Net Working Capital

- Recouped NWC at project end (i.e., last∆NWC = last WC)

Remarks

- In principle, you would like NWC’sactual value, not book value.

- These might differ for instance:

- cannot recoup full A/R,

- Inventory sells over or below book value

- etc.

- Liquidation value tends to underestimate TV unless liquidation is likely. Useful as a lower bound.

Terminal Value as Perpetuity

- No-growth perpetuity

TV = FCFT+1/ k

- For a no-growth firm, we can assume (for simplicity)

FCF = EBIT(1-t)+ Depreciation –CAPX –∆NWC

00

![](images/lecture_19_valuing_a_company-b.en_img_0.jpg)

![](images/lecture_19_valuing_a_company-b.en_img_1.jpg)

TV = EBIT(1-t)T+1/ k

Terminal Value as Growing Perpetuity

- PV in year t of a perpetuity growing at a rate g

TV = FCFT+1/ (k –g)

- For a growing perpetuity, we can assume (for simplicity)

FCF = EBIT(1-t)+ Depreciation –CAPX –∆NWC

-∆NA = -g*NA prior year

(1+g)EBIT(1-t)T

![](images/lecture_19_valuing_a_company-b.en_img_2.jpg)

![](images/lecture_19_valuing_a_company-b.en_img_3.jpg)

TV = [EBIT(1-t)T+1 –g*NAT] / (k -g)

Remarks

- Growing perpetuity -assumptions

- Net assets grow at the same rate as profits

- ∆NA is a good measure of replacement costs

- Don’t forget to discount TV further to get PVTV

- In WACC method, k=WACC

- IN APV method, k=kA for FCF and appropriate rate for TS

Example

- You are considering the acquisition of XYZ Enterprises. XYZ’sbalance sheet looks like this as of today (year 0).

Example (cont.)

What is the value of XYZ’sstock under the following assumptions:

1) XYZ is liquidated after year 5 (assuming zero salvage value).

2) Sales growth and EBIT/Sales ratios are (past year 5):

![](images/lecture_19_valuing_a_company-b.en_img_12.jpg)

Tax rate = 34%, and WACC = 13%.

Example (cont.)

Start by estimating FCF over 5 years:

- NWC(year 0) = Current assets -current liabs= 50-20=30

FCF = EBIT(1 -t) + Dep-CAPX -∆NWC

Example –Liquidation Value (LV)

1) Liquidation value (LV)

t*PPE(year 5) + NWC(year5)

PPE(year 5) = PPE(year 0) + all CAPX -all Depfrom year 0 to 5

PPE = 80

PPE * t = 80 * 34% = 27.2

LV = 27.2 + 48 = 75.2     ==&gt;  PVLV = 75.2/(1.13)5= 40.8

Firm value = 22.7 + 40.8 =  63.5

Equity value = Firm value -MV of Debt = 63.5 -30 = 33.5

Example (cont.)

For 2) to 5), we need EBIT (year 6) and NA (year 5) to apply

TV = [EBIT(year 6)(1 -t) -g*NA(year 5)]/[k -g]

EBIT(year 6)= fraction αof Sales(year 6)

= α*(1 + g)*Sales(year 5)= α*(1 + g) *293

Economic Value Added (EVA)

EVA = EBIT*(1 -t) -k*NA

![](images/lecture_19_valuing_a_company-b.en_img_17.jpg)

Intuition:Growth is good when the cost of increasing NA is more than compensated by the capitalized increase in EBIT*(1 -t).

Remarks

- EVA is a particular incarnation of NPV (+ some assumptions)

- Appeal of EVA coherent measure for Capital budgeting, Performance evaluation and Managerial compensation.

- Assumes linear relationship between NA and EBIT*(1 -t)

- EVA has nothing to do with sustainable growth:

- Sustainable growth rate answers “How fast can I grow without increasing my leverage ratio or issuing equity?”

- It has nothing to say about whether growing is good or not.

EVA: Bottom Line

Use EVA as...

- a simple measure to determine whether the business is generating value and whether growth is enhancing value

- as a way of setting goals to enhance value

Beware of EVA for...

- young companies

- companies in rapidly changing business environments

- companies where book values are not accurate measures of replacement costs

DCF Analysis: Pros and Cons

Strengths

- CF comes from specific forecasts and assumptions

- Can see impact of changes in strategies

- Valuation tied to underlying fundamentals

Weaknesses

- CF only as good as your forecasts/assumptions

- Might “forget something”

- Need to forecast managerial behavior (unless you’re in control)

- Need to estimate the discount rate using a theory (e.g., CAPM) that may be incorrect or imprecise in this particular case

Multiples

- Assess the firm’s value based on that of publicly traded comps.

- Cash-flow-based Value multiples:

- MV of firm/Earnings, MV of firm /EBITDA, MV of firm /FCF

- Cash-flow-based Price multiples:

- Price/Earnings (P/E), Price/EBITDA, Price/FCF

- Asset-based multiples:

- MV of firm/BV of assets, MV of equity/BV of equity

Procedure

- Hope:Firms in the same business should have similar multiples (e.g., P/E).

- STEP 1:Identify firms in same business as the firm you want to value.

- STEP 2:Calculate P/E ratio for comps and come up with an estimate of P/E for the firm you want to value (e.g. take the average of comps’ P/E).

- STEP 3:Multiply the estimated P/E by the actual Net Income of the firm you want to value.

Motivation for Multiples?

- Assumption 1:  Comps’ actual FCF are a perpetuity

                 gWACCFCFMV⇒−=FCFMV

![](images/lecture_19_valuing_a_company-b.en_img_19.jpg)

Motivation for Multiples?

- Assumption 1:

- E = CF to shareholders

- E is a perpetuity

                 gkEPE⇒−=Assumption 2:Comps have the same kE  =&gt; This requires similar leverage!Comps are growing at a similar rate ggk1EPE−=

Remarks

- For firms with no earnings or limited asset base (e.g.  hi-tech),

- price-to-patents multiples,

- price-to-subscribers multiples,

- or even price-to-Ph.D. multiples!

- Since these are rough approximations (at best) 

- One may want to check different multiples

- See if some multiples are quite constant across firms

Example (cont.)

- There is no exact science to come up with appropriate multiples.The following is only an example. Need experience and guts.

- ADI’s5-year sales growth is less than average

- Shade down estimate of P/E and (D+E)/EBIT*(1 -t) w.r.t. mean

- P/E = 20.9*(1 -15%) = 17.8   

- (D+E)/EBIT*(1 -t) = 23.1*(1 -15%) = 19.6

- ADI’sROE is less than average

- Shade down estimate of M/B equity and M/B firm w.r.t. mean

- M/B equity = 4.6*(1 -15%) = 3.9

- M/B firm = 3.5*(1 -15%) = 3.0

Comparables: Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Simple + lots of information

- Market consensus about discount rate and growth rate.

- Free-ride on market’s information.

Cons:

- Assumes that companies are alike in growth, costs of capital, business composition, leverage

- Hard to find true comps

- Hard to incorporate firm specific information

- Accounting differences

- If everyone uses comps, who actually does fundamental analysis?

Comps &amp; the Conglomerate Discount

- Is the value of a conglomerate equal to the sum of its parts?

- Calculate Firm Value / Assets for the conglomerate

- For each of its business segments (in annual report), calculate median Firm Value / Assets for single segment firms in that industry

- Add up these comps, weighting by the share of the conglomerate’sassets in that industry

- Result: On average, conglomerates are worth 12% less than the sum of their parts.

Possible Interpretations

- Conglomerates are an inefficient form of organization

- The stock market doesn’t get it

Book values can vary across firms depending on age of PPE. If everyone uses comps, who actually does fundamental analysis?

Finance Theory II

May 14, 2003

Final Exam

- Rules of the game:

- No laptops

- Closed books

- Cheat sheet

Valuation

Valuation tools:

- Free cash flows

- Cost of capital: WACC and APV

- Real options

Valuing companies

- DCF analysis:

- Forecast horizon and terminal values

- EVA: When is growth good?

- Comparables, Multiples

Estimating the FCF

- Free cash flows (FCF) are the expectedafter-tax cash flows that the firm would generate if it were 100% equity financed.

FCF = EBIT*(1-t) + Dep. -CAPX -∆NWC

FCF = EBITD*(1-t) + t * Dep. -CAPX -∆NWC

FCF = EBIT*(1-t) -∆NA

Recall:

- NWC = Current assets –Current liabilities

- NA = Assets –Current liabilities.

FCF = EBIT*(1-t) + Dep. -CAPX -∆WC

- This expression amends EBIT(1-t) which is an accounting measure of cash flow into an economic measure.

- CAPX not reported as cash outflow but is one -CAPX

- Depreciation

- is reported as cash outflow but is not one Add (1-t)*Dep

- however, depreciation does imply a cash inflow of t*Dep.

- Altogether + Dep

- Working capital has an opportunity cost -∆NWC

Other Things to Keep In Mind

- Formulas need to be adapted in particular situations

- Need to understand the economics (e.g., Southland’s asset sales)

- Use all incrementalcash flows: 

- Ignore sunk costs, Count opportunity costs, Avoid “accounting illusions”…

- Don’t forget FCF at the end of the project’s life:

- If liquidated: SV*(1-t) + t * PPE

- Even if not liquidated, recoup WC

- FCF ignores the tax shield provided by the firm’s debt.

- We deal with it separately in APV or WACC. Do not include the effects of financing at this stage: You would count them twice!

APV Step 1: Value if 100% equity

![](images/lecture_21_wrap-up_of_valuation-b.en_img_0.jpg)

1.Identify comps, i.e., publicly traded pure plays in same business.2.Unlever each comp’s βEto estimate its βA using(OK if the comp’s D not too high (+ can assume their D/V is stable))3.Use the comps’ βA to estimate the project’s βA(e.g., as average).4.Use estimated βA to calculate the all-equity cost of capital kA5.Use kAto discount the project’s FCFDEEββEA+=PremiumRisk  MarketrkAfA⋅β+=

Why We Need to Unlever

- Comps may have different leverage

- Equity in a firm with debt is more risky than equity in a firm without debt because debt receives some of the safe cashflows.

Note: Business Risk and Financial Risk

- Financial risk has nothing to do with costs of financial distress!

- Similar firms have similar business risk (βA) but can have different financial risk (βE-βA) if they have different leverage.

- As leverage increases, equity becomes riskier (i.e. βE ).

APV Step 2: Add PV (Tax Shield)

- If the project’s D is constant over time, then 

PV(TS) = t*D*kD/ kD= t*D

- If the project’s D/V is constant, then

PV(TS) = t*D*kD / kA 

- If there is a known debt policy or repayment schedule

- you can simply forecast actual debt levels and discount by a rate between kD and kA

APV Step 2: Add PV (Tax Shield), Remarks

- Count only debt attributed to the project

- Recall: If a project is 100% debt finance, some of the debt is probably issued against firm’s other assets

- Make sure to discount expectednot maximum tax shields

- This is particularly important for high D/V

- For high D/V, should count costs of financial distress

- Recall: Use the marginal (as opposed to the average) tax rate

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

- Approach: Adjust the discount rate to account for the tax shield.

- Most widely used DCF analysis method.

- The aim is to avoid 1st order mistakes:

- A priori, WACC is project-specific (except for tax rate t)

- Firm-wide WACC is OK only if project comparable to the firm

![](images/lecture_21_wrap-up_of_valuation-b.en_img_1.jpg)

EDkEDEt)(1kEDDWACC++−+=

Leverage ratio: D/(D+E)

- What we want: The debt that is incremental to the project, i.e.,that could not be raised w/o the project.

- 1st-order mistakes we want to avoid:

- Use the deal’s leverage ratio;

- Use the “acquirer”’s leverage ratio.

- Imperfect approach to what we want:

- Target leverage ratio if project/firm were a stand-alone

- How we get there:

- Get D/V from comps, business plan, checklist, etc.

Cost of debt capital: kD

- What we want: Expected return for creditors if project were a stand-alone with leverage ratio D/(D+E) estimated above.

- Imperfect approach to what we want: kDclose the interest rate charged to project as stand-alone (unless debt is very risky).

- How we get there:

- Find comps with similar leverage + recent interest rate.

- Estimate the debt rating and examine corporate yield curve.

- 1st-order mistakes we want to avoid:

- Use the interest rate in the deal or of the “acquirer”;

Effective Marginal Tax Rate t

- Marginal tax rate of firm undertaking the project: t

Using CAPM to Estimate kE

1.Find compsfor the project under consideration.

2.Unlevereach comp’s βE(using itsD/(D+E)):

3.Use the comps’ βA to estimate the project’s βA(e.g. average).

4.Releverthe project’s estimated βA (using its own D/(D+E)):

5.Use the estimated βE to calculate the project’s cost of equity kE:

Note: These (un-) levering formulas are OK only if the (comp) firm’s debt is nottoo risky and its D/V is reasonably stable.

Remarks

- WACC can be used only if D/V is reasonably stable

- Use APV when debt is very risky and/or when D/V is unstable (recall the Southland LBO case)

- WACC is an attribute of the project, not the firm (except tax rate)

- OK to use the firm’s WACC when project is very much like the firm (because the firm happens to be a comp for the project).

- Few companies have WACC that they can use for all projects (recall our discussion of GE).

Real options

Embedded options

- Follow-up investments

- Option to abandon the project

- Option to wait before investing

- Option to expand / change production methods

Key issues

- Identification

- Valuation

Identify significantoptions

- Look for clues in project’s description and cash flow pattern

- “Phases”, “Strategic investment”, “Scenarios”…

- Large expenditures are likely discretionary

- Is there an option? Verify two conditions:

(1) News will possibly arrive in the future;

(2) When it arrives, the news may affect decisions.

- Search for the uncertainty that managers face:

- What is the main thing that managers will learn over time?

- How will they exploit that information?

Practical Issue: Simplifications

- Search for significantoptions

- E.g., option to shut down the plant may not be very valuable (why?)

- Look for primary sources of uncertainty

- Cut the projects into simpleoptions

- You might want to ignore nested options (difficult to value)

- Use Europeanrather than American option

- Ignoring some adverse effects of waiting (e.g. possible entry)

![](images/lecture_21_wrap-up_of_valuation-b.en_img_5.jpg)

A simplified model that is dominated by the project gives a lower boundfor the project’s value (and vice versa).

Value the options

Step 1:

- Start with the simple DCF analysis

- Pretend that there is no option embedded in the project

- This benchmark constitute a lower boundfor the project’s value

Step 2:

- Value the option

- Decision trees (dynamic DCF)

- Option pricing models (Black-Scholes)

Practical Issue: What Volatility?

What do we want?

- Standard deviation of returns for the underlying asset

- In case of real options, the underlying is the PV of the project’s CFs

Imperfect ways to get it?

- Informed guess

- 20-30% per year is not remarkably high for a single project.

- Data

- Historical return volatilities on comparable traded assets

- Implied volatilities can be computed from quoted option prices

- Simulations

Valuing Companies

- Terminal values:

- Liquidation

- Flat, growing, or decreasing perpetuity

- EVA: When is growth good?

- Comparables, Multiples.

Terminal Values

- Liquidation:Should be adjusted (e.g. if cannot recoup all A/R, etc.)

SV * (1-t) + t*PPE + WC

- Growing perpetuity:Take EBIT and NA in last year of forecast

TV = [(1+g)*EBIT*(1-t) -g*NA] / (k-g)

- Flat perpetuity:

TV = EBIT*(1-t) / k

Terminal Values, Remarks

- Growing perpetuity formula assumes a linear relationship between EBIT and NA

- Don’t forget to take PVTV

- Forecast horizon: Company is reasonably stable afterwards

EVA

- Growth is valuable when (very roughly!):

EVA = EBIT*(1-t) -k*NA &gt; 0or    EBIT*(1-t) / NA &gt; k

- Growth is good if the cost of scaling up NA is offset by the value of increased revenues.

Remarks:

- Assumes linearity between EBIT and NA and that NA is a good measure of marginal “replacement cost”, now and in the future.

- EVA has nothing to do with sustainable growth.

EVA: Bottom Line

Use EVA as…

- … a simple measure of whether a business is generating value and whether growth is enhancing value

- … as a way of setting goals to enhance value

Beware of EVA for...

- … young companies

- … companies in rapidly changing business environment

- … companies in which book values are not accurate measures of marginal replacement cost.

Multiples

- Assess the value based on that of publicly traded comps

- Cash-flow based Value multiples

- MV(firm)/Earnings, MV(firm)/EBITDA, MV(firm)/FCF,...

- Cash-flow based Price multiples:

- Price/Earnings, Price/EBITDA, Price/FCF,...

- Asset-based multiples:

- MV(firm)/BV(assets), MV(equity)/BV(equity),...

Motivation for Multiples?

- Assumption 1:

- E = CF to shareholders

- E is a perpetuity

                 gkEPE⇒−=Assumption 2:Comps have the same kE  =&gt; This requires similar leverage!Comps are growing at a similar rate ggk1EPE−=

Multiples: Pros and Cons

Pros:

- Incorporates simply a lot of information from other valuations

- Embodies market consensus

- Can provide discipline for DCF valuation: Ask yourself “How do Iexplain the difference?”

- Sometimes, what you care about is what the market will pay, not the fundamental value (e.g., Venture firm will want out).

Cons:

- Hard to incorporate firm specific information.

- Relies on accounting measures being comparable too.

Other Things to Think About

Control:

- With a controlling stake, influence operations, implement synergies and capture (part of) their value

- Also, entrepreneur might care about “the vision”

Large individual shareholder (e.g., entrepreneur):

- Maybe very undiversified, at least for a while 

Liquidity:

- Especially for private companies

- Note: Need to account for IPO plans

Valuation: Conclusion

- Main merit of DCF analysis: Forces to argue where value comes from Most important step is a reasonableforecast of FCF.

- Sales forecasts: Reasonable given the firm’s resources, the industry, and competition? What market share is needed?

- Margin forecasts: Reasonable given potential competition/entry barriers and bargaining position with suppliers and customers?

- CAPX and other investment forecasts: Consistent with the sales and margin forecasts?

- Terminal value: Does it make sense?

- Sensitivity analysis: What variables and assumptions are crucialto the value? Get more information about these levers.

Valuation: Conclusion

- The different methods are not mutually exclusive.

- Comparables and multiples are important but:

- don’t tell you where value comes from;

- whether comparables are really comparable.

- DCF analysis (+ Real options) forces to justify valuation but:

- only as good as the data input;

- relies on imperfect models.

- Go back and forth between the two approaches.

Course: Conclusion

What We Have Been About

- Acquire a few general tools:

- Capital structure

- DCF analysis

- Comparalesand multiples

- Avoiding 1st order misconceptions (list your own below if any):

- etc.

- Developing a healthy skepticism.

Financing

- The bulk of the value is created on the LHS by making good investment decisions.

- You can destroy much value by mismanaging your RHS: Financial policy should be supporting your business strategy.

- You cannot make sound financial decisions without knowing the implications for the business.

- Avoid one-size-fit-all approaches.

- Finance is too serious to leave it to finance people.

- Avoid one-size-fit-all approaches.

- Business is too serious to leave it to business people.
