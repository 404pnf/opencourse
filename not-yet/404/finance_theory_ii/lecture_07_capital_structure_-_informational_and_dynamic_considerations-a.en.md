They follow a “pecking order” in which they finance investment: first with internally generated funds They may even forgo positive NPV investments because of reluctance to raise additional external financing. The willingness to issue equity fluctuates over time. Something is missing from the “trade-off theory” view

This ensures that financial transactions have NPV = 0. But this may not always be a good description of reality: Inefficient markets Managers with more information than investors

7 D D D D D than issue equity. Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Managers prefer to issue equity when equity is overvalued. Thus, equity issues signal to investors that equity is overvalued. Thus, stock price declines at equity issue announcements. Consequently, managers avoid issuing equity. In some cases, they may even forgo positive NPV projects rather Managers with more information than investors -The Lemons Problem: Suppose that managers have more information about the firm than outside investors.

Explains why internal funds are preferred to equity for many firms. But why is debt preferred to equity? Are other financial securities less sensitive to information asymmetries than equity? Hybrid securities (e.g. convertible debt)? When equity is undervalued, managers prefer internal financing to issuing equity to outside investors.

13 • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Why Is Safe Debt Better Than Equity? Its value is independent of the information Managers and the market give it the same value Safe debt is fairly priced, hence no under-pricing Note: Risky debt is underpriced, but less so than equity. Will still want to issue risky debt instead of equity. However, for high leverage, costs of financial distress should be taken into account. Equity might dominate debt in this case.

14 Example (cont.): Underinvestment • • →→• →→==&gt; Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Suppose investment outlay is $18M not $12M. NPV = -18 + 22/1.1 = $2M Raising $18M requires selling 15% of shares (after issue), valued by the market at 120 (i.e., 100 + 20). Existing shareholders get 85% * (150 + 20) = $144.5M They lose $5.5M relative to $150M if did not invest. Another way to see this: Loss due to under-valuation 15%*(170-120) = $7.5M Exceeds the project’s value of $2M XYZ will not issue equity to fund project.

Assume that the firm has no cash and cannot issue debt. If assets are worth $150M, the firm does not invest. Upon seeing the firm issuing equity, the market infers that it must be sitting on negative info: assets are worth only $50M. Given the market’s expectations that the firm was worth $100M, the firm’s market value drops to 50 + 20 = $70M when the firm announces the equity issue.

Internal vs. External Finance The same project is worth more with internal than external Debt vs. Equity Financing The same project is worth more with debt than equity financing Some projects will be undertaken only if funded internally or with relatively safe debt but not if financed with risky debt or equity.

17 Financial Policy • • • →→Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Take Away 2: Information Content of Stock issues convey negative information about the firm. This explains why the market reacts negatively to equity issues. More generally: Firms’ financial policies convey information. Stock prices will react to changes in financial policy (e.g., dividends, issues, etc.)

19 Capital Structure: • • 1) • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Take Away 3 -The Pecking Order Theory of Financing choices are driven by the desire to minimize losses due to asymmetric information. When funding their investment projects, firms will: First use retained earnings; 2 ) Then borrow from debt markets (unless already highly leveraged); 3) As a last resort, issue equity. Firms with more information asymmetries are more reluctant to issue equity, and try to preserve borrowing capacity.

20 Implications: • →→• • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter If Pecking Order holds, a company’s leverage ratio results: not from an attempt to approach a target ratio; but rather from series of incremental financing  decisions. Contrary to the Target Capital Structure Approach, the Pecking Order implies that capital structure can move around a lot. The Pecking Order Theory also implies that profitable firms will lower their leverage ratios to build up “financial slack”. The idea is to avoid future equity issues in case unexpected funding needs arise.
