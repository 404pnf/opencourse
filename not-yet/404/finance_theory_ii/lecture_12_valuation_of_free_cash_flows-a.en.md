Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter A key task of managers is to undertake valuation exercises in order to allocate capital between mutually exclusive projects: Is the project’s version A better than its modified version A’? The process of valuation and ultimately of capital budgeting generally involves many factors, some formal, some not (experience, hard-to-formalize information, politics, etc.). We will focus on financial tools

Step 1: Estimate the Free Cash Flows. Step 2: Assess the risk of the free cash flows. Step 3: Account for the effect of financing on value. Preview of Step 3: Two ways to account for tax shield: Adjust the discount rate (WACC method). Adjust the cash flow estimate (APV method).

If project requires follow-on CAPX or additional working capital, take these into account. After-tax: The rest goes to the IRS. Be consistent in your treatment of inflation: Discount nominal cash flows at nominal discount rates. Nominal rates reflect inflation in overall economy, but inflation in cash flows may be different. In fact, some items in cash flows, e.g., depreciation, may have no inflation.

Sunk costs should be ignored They are spent w/ or w/o the project (bygones are bygones). Opportunity costs should be accounted for A project might exclude good alternatives (e.g., use of land). Accounting illusions should be avoided e.g. the project might be “charged” for a fraction of expenses that would be incurred anyway.

20 Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Changes in (Net) Working Capital: Working Capital = Inventory + A/R -A/P Remark 1: • Many projects need some capital to be tied up (working capital) which constitutes an opportunity cost.  We need the Change in Working Capital implied by the project. Remark 2: • Accounting measure of earnings are based on: Sales -Cost of Goods Sold • But: Income and expense are reported when a sale is declared. →COGS in 2000 includes the costs of items sold in 2000 even if the cost was incurred in 1999 or hasn’t been incurred yet. →Sales in 2000 include the income from items sold in 2000 even if the payment has not been received yet.

Typically, we start by estimating equity betas from a regression of equity returns on stock market returns. Problem: Sometimes we need to use the betas on “comparable” firms, either because there is insufficient data on the project available, or because we try to improve the precision of the estimate in that way. This “comparable firms” procedure for the estimation of asset betas is explained on the next slide.

29 An approach for estimating the asset beta: 1) 2) 3) above: i. stock returns on market returns. ii. iii. 4) Calculate the asset beta for our firm as the average of the asset betas of the comparable firms. Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Recognize that all firms that generate cash flow streams with the same risk will have the same asset beta. Identify firms that are likely to have cash flow streams that have similar risk. These are the “comparable” firms. Estimate asset betas for the comparable firms using the formula Estimate equity betas for each comparable firm by regressing Estimate debt betas for each comparable firm in the same manner. Usually, you won’t have data to do this. In practice, it is common to assume that debt is risk free (debt beta of zero), or to assume debt betas between 0.1 and 0.3, which come from empirical studies of corporate debt returns. We need to be more careful if leverage is high. Estimate the market value (D+E) of the firm as the sum of the market values of the debt and equity of the firm. If market value of debt (D) is not available, proxy with book value of debt.
