3 Real Options: Valuing Flexibility • • • Example: •  Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter The “Real Options Approach” assess the value of managerial flexibility in responding to new information. Managers have many options to adapt and revise decisions in response to new and unexpected developments. Such flexibility is clearly valuable and should be accounted for in the valuation of a project or firm. Often, managers can expand or contract production in response to changes in demand. The firm would be less valuable if they had to choose a fixed production level before knowing the level of demand.

6 • • • →→• Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Identifying Real Options It is important to identify the options imbedded in a project. There are options imbedded in all but the most trivial projects. The most crucial skill consists of: Identifying those options that are “significant”, if any. Ignoring those that are not. Identifying real options takes practice, and sometimes “vision”. 

# Example: Oz Toys’ Expansion Program 

- Oz Toys’ management is considering building a new plant to exploit innovations in process technology. 

- About three years out, the plant’s capacity may be expanded to allow Oz Toys’ entry into a new market.

Such projects are often presented as having “strategic value”. •Examples: Developing applications if R&amp;D is successful. Movie Production

Growth options can be “nested”, i.e., series of related choices: Rocky 3 Growth options can be very valuable and account for over half of the market value of some industries. industries with heavy R&amp;D. industries with multiple proect generations (e.g. computers, pharmaceuticals). Industries with multinational operations.

13 Abandonment Options: • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter The Option to Shut-down An investment includes an abandonment option if, under certain circumstances, it may be preferable to shut down current operations permanently and realize the resale value of capital equipment and other assets in secondhand markets. Sometimes, abandonment options are hidden in aggregated forecasts: While it may be preferable to continue operations on average, shutting down may be better under some scenarios. Abandonment options are akin to Put options: You have the option (but no obligation) to get rid of something and receive a payment (the liquidation value).

In extreme cases, production can temporarily halt and start again. Similar to growth and abandonment options. •Examples: Ability to slow the rate of mineral extraction from a mine. Ability to add a temporary third shift at a factory.

15 Timing Options: Option to accelerate or decelerate projects • • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Retaining some flexibility about the timing of an investment (possibly including “never”) can be very valuable. Example: A patent’s value should account for the timing option, i.e., when buying the patent, you are buying the right to use it whenever you want (during the patent’s lifetime). Akin to an American call option: You have the option (but not the obligation) to get something at any time by paying a cost. Note: Only those investment timing problems for which relevant information is likely to arrive involve “option value”.

Each stage can be viewed as a call option on the value of subsequent stages, and valued as a compound option. Important in: all R&amp;D intensive industries, especially pharmaceuticals; long-development capital-intensive projects, e.g., large-scale construction or energy-generating plants; start-up ventures.

Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Real projects, especially long-horizon ones, are complex: They often combine assets-in-place and options. Options are often nested.

20 Practical Issue: Simplifications (cont.) • • • →Examples: • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter What should you do? Cut the project into pieces corresponding to simple options. Search for the primary uncertainty that managers face. A simplified model that dominates (is dominated by) the project gives an upper (a lower) bound for the project’s value. Using European rather than American options. Ignoring some of the options. Ignoring some adverse effects of waiting (e.g. possible entry).

Make simplifying assumptions about the distribution of the project’s value.

Black-Scholes is often used to value real options. PROBLEM: Real options are much more complex than financial options. Need to simplify them to fit them into the valuation models for financial options. Similar to DCF analysis, the aim is to develop numerical techniques to “keep score” and assist in the decision-making process, not to replace sound business sense.

This benchmark constitute a lower bound for the project’s value. Then introduce flexibility / optionality into the decision making process: NPV&lt;0 does not mean that you will never want to undertake NPV&gt;0 does not mean that you should go ahead immediately with the invest (nor that you will definitely invest

Note: When B=0, only the project’s NPV matters (whether A&gt;1) because either the decision has to be taken now (T=0) or it might just as well be taken now as no news will arrive (=0).

38 Interpretation: • • →Sensitivity analysis →• Iterative process. • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Since we use simplified models, the results need to be taken with a grain of salt and interpreted. Put complexity back into the model with: Conditioning and qualifying of inferences Helps you identify the main levers of the project, and where you need to gather more data or fine tune the analysis.
