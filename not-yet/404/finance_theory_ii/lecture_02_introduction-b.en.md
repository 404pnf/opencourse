Types of questions

Investment and financing decisions

- Your firm needs to raise capital to finance growth.  

- Should you issue debt or equity or obtain a bank loan?

- How will the stock market react to your decision? 

- If you choose debt, should the bonds be convertible?  callable? Long or short maturity?

- If you choose equity, what are the trade-offs between common and preferred stock?

Types of questions, cont.

Investment and financing decisions

- IBM recently announced that it would repurchase $2.5 billion in stock.  Its price jumped 7% after the announcement.  Why?  How would themarket have reacted if IBM increased dividends instead?  SupposeIntel made the same announcement.  Would we expect the same price response?

- Motorola wants to build a new chip factory in Ireland.  How willfluctuations in the foreign exchange rate affect the value of the project?  What are the risks?  What actions can Motorola take to hedge therisks?  More importantly, should it hedge the risks?  What are the costs and benefits?
