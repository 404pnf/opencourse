The professor is motivated by his teaching ratings (because he doesn’t want the Dean to beat him up). It is a bad idea to fill out the teaching rates before the professor has delivered the review! You are inviting moral Similar to the Southland case – don’t let crucial players cash out too early!

Cash-flow-based Value multiples: MV of firm/Earnings, MV of firm /EBITDA, MV of firm /FCF Cash-flow-based Price multiples: Price/Earnings (P/E), Price/EBITDA, Price/FCF (Book) Asset-based multiples: MV of firm/BV of assets, MV of equity/BV of equity

Requires similar levels of risk. Requires similar expected growth rates. Identify firms in same business as the firm you want to Calculate P/E ratio for comps and come up with an estimate of P/E for the firm you want to value (e.g. take the Multiply the estimated P/E by the actual Net Income of the firm you want to value.

For transactions, can also use multiples for comparable transactions (e.g. similar takeovers). Multiples based on equity value (or stock price, e.g. P/E) as opposed to total firm value ignore effect of leverage on the cost of equity (or assume the firms have similar leverage) =&gt; Beware if comps have very different leverage.

8 Comparables: Pros and Cons Pros: • • rate. • • Cons: • • • measures. • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Incorporates a lot of information from other valuations in a simple way. Embodies market consensus about (comp’s) discount rate and growth Free-ride on market’s information. Can provide discipline in valuation process by ensuring that your valuation is in line with other valuations. Implicitly assumes that comps are alike in growth rates, cost of capital, and business composition. Hard to find true comps. Hard time incorporating firm specific information. Particularly problematic if operating changes are going to be implemented. Accounting differences, particularly with earnings and equity-based Multiples of FCF and EBITDA preferable for this reason. Book values can vary across firms depending on age of PPE. If everyone uses comps, who actually does fundamental analysis?

11 Estimating the FCF • ∆∆NWC ∆NA Recall: • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Free cash flows (FCF) are the expected after-tax cash flows that the firm would generate if it were 100% equity financed. FCF = EBIT*(1-t) + Depreciation -CAPX -NWC FCF = EBITD*(1-t) + t * Depreciation -CAPX -FCF = EBIT*(1-t) -NWC = Current assets – Current liabilities NA = Assets – Current liabilities.

If not liquidated: Terminal values. FCF ignores the tax shield provided by the firm’s debt. We deal with it separately in APV or WACC. Do not include the effects of financing at this stage: You would count them twice!

15 Embedded Real Options: • • • • →→Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Real Options = Managerial flexibility to react to new information. Sometimes, much of a project’s value is in embedded options. Conditions for there to be an option: (1) New information will possibly arrive in the future. (2) When it arrives, the new information may affect decisions. Frequently encountered options: Options to grow, abandon, expand/contract, time, switch (inputs, outputs, processes, etc.) Valuation: Black-Scholes Scenario analysis and decision trees

Sales forecasts: Reasonable given the firm’s resources, the industry, and competition? What market share is needed? Margin forecasts: Reasonable given potential competition/entry barriers and bargaining position with suppliers and customers? CAPX and other investment forecasts: Consistent with the sales and margin forecasts? Terminal value: Does it make sense? Sensitivity analysis: What variables and assumptions are crucial to the value?

Comparables and multiples are important but: don’t tell you where value comes from; whether comparables are really comparable. DCF analysis (+ real options) forces to justify valuation but: only as good as the data input; relies on imperfect models. Go back and forth between the two approaches.

19 • • • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Financing The bulk of the value is created on the LHS by making good investment decisions. You can destroy much value by mismanaging your RHS: Financial policy should be supporting your business strategy. You cannot make sound financial decisions without knowing the implications for the business. Avoid one-size-fit-all approaches. Finance is too important to leave it to finance people.

20 Valuation • • • →→• • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Making sound business decisions requires valuing them. This involves mostly knowing the business (to make appropriate cash-flow forecasts and scenario analyses) But also some finance: What discount rate? Valuation exercises help to identify the key value drivers and often inform the business strategy. Avoid one-size-fit-all approaches. Business is too important to leave it to business people.
