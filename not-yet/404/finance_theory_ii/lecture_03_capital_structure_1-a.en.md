More generally, can you add value on the RHS of the balance   by following a good financial policy? If yes, does the optimal financial policy depend on the firm’s operations (Real Investment policy), and how?

11 M-M’s “Irrelevance” Theorem • • Proof: • • price. • Q.E.D. Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter MM Theorem (without taxes for now). Financing decisions are irrelevant for firm value. In particular, the choice of capital structure is irrelevant. From Finance Theory I, Purely financial transactions do not change the total cash flows and are therefore zero NPV investments. With no arbitrage opportunities, they cannot change the total Thus, they neither increase nor decrease firm value.

14 M-M Intuition 1 • • • • of how the pie is divided up. Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter If Firm A were to adopt Firm B’s capital structure, its total value would not be affected (and vice versa). This is because ultimately, its value is that of the cash flows generated by its operating assets (e.g., plant and inventories). The firm’s financial policy divides up this cashflow “pie” among different claimants (e.g., debtholders and equityholders). But the size (i.e.,  value) of the pie is independent

Can you spot an arbitrage opportunity? 

# Proof 2 (cont.) 

• Arbitrage strategy: 

- Buy 1/1M of Firm B’s equity for $50 

- Buy 1/1M of Firm B’s debt for $50 

- Sell 1/1M of Firm A’s equity for $105

18 M-M: Intuition 2 • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Investors will not pay a premium for firms that undertake financial transactions that they can undertake themselves (at the same cost). For instance, they will not pay a premium for Firm A over Firm B for having less debt. Indeed, by combining Firm B’s debt and equity in appropriate proportions, any investor can in effect “unlever” Firm B and reproduce the cashflow of Firm A.

But it applies to all aspects of financial policy: capital structure is irrelevant. long-term vs. short-term debt is irrelevant. risk management is irrelevant.

But it gets you to ask the right question: How is this financing move going to change the size of the pie? M-M exposes some popular fallacies such as the “WACC
