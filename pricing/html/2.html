<h1>PRICING ECONOMIC VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER</h1>
<h2>DEFINITION</h2>
<p>Economic Value to the Customer (EVC) is based on the insight that a customer will buy a product only if its value to them outweighs the value of the closest alternative, or when Utilitya &gt;= Utilityb. The utility of a product depends on its value to the customer minus its price. </p>

<p>Therefore, to sell a product, a rm needs to price at or below its competitors price plus the value advantage its product has to the customer over the rival product. </p>
<h2>EVC EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>Atlantic Computer has developed software that allows their servers to host twice as much webspace as its rivals. How should they price this new software-server combination? </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Relative to buying two servers from Atlantics competitor, by buying one doubly ecient server from Atlantic, a rm would save \$4,000 in labor costs, \$500 in electricity and \$1,500 in software licenses. This suggests that the dierentiation value relative to the closest competitive oering is \$6,000. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The price of two servers from the competitor is \$6,800. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This suggests that the EVC of a server with the software is \$6,000 + \$6,800 = \$12,800. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Practical Implementation of EVC analysis in a firm</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify what benet your product provides </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure you dene a benet, not a feature. Skill here reaps large rewards. </p>
<p>Xerox became very protable because it priced per photocopy. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify closest competitive oering and calculate its price </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be honest about who your closest competitor is </p>
<p>For example, even though a B2B online video-calling service may want to compare itself to dedicated-line video-conferencing systems, its real closest competitor is Skype, which is free. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be honest with yourself about the price that competitors sell their product for.</p>
<p>For example, a web back-up company calculated an EVC price that was 100 percent greater than what they were charging. However, they omitted to include the fact that all their rivals discounted at 80 percent from list. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the units and time-horizon right. This is far easier to do when you have dened the products benet properly. </p>
<p>For example, an cleaning product manufacturer left money on the table by not reecting the fact that its cleaner cleaned twice as much as its competitor. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify potential sources of dierentiation value </p>
<ul>
<li>Be specic, not vague. It is important that your rms value proposition does not sound like it was churned out by generic software. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure how much value these create </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have an independent lab do measurable testing. </p>
<p>For example, an air-lter company got a lab to measure the number of dust particles in the air and estimate the eect this would have on asthma suerers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often current customers are willing to take part in benchmarking studies, as they view it as free consulting. </p>
<p>For example, W.W. Grainger oered consulting and measurement incentives to 15 clients who agreed to participate. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the reference price and dierentiation values together to get EVC. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The next challenge is to determine how far below EVC the rm's ideal price point will be. </p>
<h2>HOW FAR SHOULD  A FIRM DISCOUNT FROM EVC?</h2>
<p>It is a common misperception that EVC analysis implies that a rm should price at the EVC. This is not the case. The EVC describes only the maximum price a rm might theoretically charge. Generally, a rm will decide to forego some of their dierentiation value.<sup id="fnref:1-2"><a href="#fn:1-2" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> There is some neurological basis for this fairness eect'.<sup id="fnref:1-3"><a href="#fn:1-3" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're standing on the sidewalk with a friend, minding your own business, when a man approaches with a proposition. He oers you \$20 in one-dollar bills and says you can keep the money, under one condition: You have to share some of it with another person. You can oer this other person as much or as little as you like, but if they reject your oer, neither of you get to keep any of the money. What do you do? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggests a 50 percent discount rule. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, Atlantic Computer ultimately priced not at the suggested EVC, but instead discounted its dierentiation value by 50 percent (\$3,000), so that it priced the product at \$9,800. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Set price closer to EVC if</em>. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>End-Benet eect:  When your product is an essential part of a known end-use. </p>
<ul>
<li>Since Bridal Bouquets are a small but essential part of a large and expensive end product, orists are able to charge a great deal more for them than for other bouquets. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared-Cost eect: When the cost is shared. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business hotels have been able to capture the customer's dierentiation value for pillow-top mattresses and expensive bedding because usually the rm is paying for the hotel stay. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advantageous mental account: Customers have dierent mental accounts which they evaluate separately when they make purchase decisions. Price closer to EVC if your product falls into an advantageous mental account such as Vacation Money' or Tax Refund Money. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, success of travel agency selling Las Vegas packages that oered a \$300 tax rebate special to coincide with the 2008 Bush tax rebate checks. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>May have to price well below EVC if</em>. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Uncertainty Eect: Uncertainty over realization of attributes </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a new anti-dandru shampoo was unable to command a price premium because its claims could not be veried by experts and consumers knew that its eectiveness would vary. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Newness Eect: Attributes are new and therefore hard to understand </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, Boxee is a 'freeware cross-platform media center software with social networking features that is a fork of the open source XBMC media center software with some custom and proprietary additions'. Since customers are unlikely to understand the value that implies, they may have to price below EVC when they release their hardware (allegedly) in 2010. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make clear this is temporary. 1969 study: Five brands in two stores. One had discount from initial price, other had no sign of discount. In all ve cases, the store that had marked the discount as being from the list price did better in the long run. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expenditure eect: When it is a larger proportion of expenditure. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, an industrial carpet cleaner could charge higher prices to oce managers than dedicated oce cleaning companies. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When it is ethically right or legally appropriate to do so </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bottled water priced at \$35 for a 12 pack during Hurricane Rita </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>North Carolina Price Gouging Law'. North Carolina denes price gouging as intentionally charging an unreasonably excessive price under the circumstances for goods or services that are used by North Carolinians during an emergency to preserve, protect or sustain life, health, safety or economic well-being. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>May wish to price below EVC for strategic reasons if</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Winner-takes-all market </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial Customer Lock-In </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-empt competitive response </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We discuss these in detail in weeks 3-6 of the course. </p>
<p>There are three ways that EVC analysis gets used (as a formula, as a guideline and as a diagnostic), which we now discuss in turn. </p>
<h2>USING EVS AS A PRICING FORMULA</h2>
<p>It is best to use EVC as a pricing formula </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When competitor's prices are well-known and concrete </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a product's dierentiation value is easy to calibrate </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a product's dierentiation value is easy and believable to communicate </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Atlantic Computing example is an almost ideal setting for the use of EVC as a formula. </p>
<p>The ideal setting for the use of EVC as a formula is one where the seller knows precisely how the customer will use the product, and intimate details of their likely cost savings or net benets of using the technology. This generally implies a manufacturing or engineering setting. This is no surprise, since consultants developed EVC analysis for these kind of industries. EVC can be particularly useful as a tool to help the sales force sell and prevent price erosion by allowing them to answer questions like: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How can you justify charging that much for your product? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why should I buy your product when your competitor's product is \$3,000 cheaper? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is most worthwhile for our rm to keep in mind about your oering? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the system should not be so complex that sales people bypass it. </p>
<h2>USING EVC AS A PRICING GUIDELINE FOR NEW PRODUCTS</h2>
<p>EVC can be useful for a rm that is choosing the initial price of its product. The classic example of this is Zantac. As a second entrant to the stomach ulcer market, it may have been natural for them to price at or just under the incumbent's (Tagamets) price. However, EVC analysis demonstrated large dierentiation value because of the twice-daily dosage format and fewer side eects, and as a consequence they priced at 50 percent above the incumbents price. In two years they were the market leader.</p>
<h2>USING EVC AS A PRICING DIAGNOSTIC FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS</h2>
<p>EVC is a useful tool for establishing whether an existing product that is performing poorly is overpriced or mis-promoted </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Overpriced </p>
<ul>
<li>Segway recognized that compared to its EVC, segways were felt by the majority of customers to be overpriced at a price point of \$3,000. Therefore the Segway company focused on nding ways of reducing the average price, such as the use of Segway on one-day city tours. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value message is not focused on crucial dierentiation value </p>
<ul>
<li>Michelin initially emphasized all its points of dierentiation value such as longevity, speed and safety, in its advertising. Customer tests revealed that their most salient and easy to communicate dierentiation value was safety, and Michelin switched its advertising to emphasize that, with great success. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value message is not being communicated eectively </p>
<ul>
<li>Duracell found out that its value message that it lasted for longer was not believed by customers. Therefore they switched from a quantitative message to one that emphasized that consumers should use Duracell batteries when reliability was crucial. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is essential to conduct a form of EVC analysis before instituting a price cut, to protect management from making the wrong decision. </p>
