Target Capital Structure Approach

1.Start with M-M Irrelevance

2.Add two ingredients that change the size of the pie.

- Taxes

- Expected Distress Costs

3.Trading off the two gives you the “static optimum” capital structure. (“Static” because this view suggests that a company should keep its debt relatively stable over time.)

Implications of the “target leverage” approach

- Firms should:

- Issue equity when leverage rises above the target level

- Buy back stock (or pay dividends) when leverage falls below the target capital structure

- Stock market should:

- React positively (or neutrally) to announcements  of securities issues

What really happens?

- Stock prices drop (on average) at the announcements of equity issues

- Companies are reluctant to issue equity

- They follow a “pecking order” in which they finance investment:

- first with internally generated funds

- then with debt

- and finally with equity

- Willingness to issue equity fluctuates over time

Something is missing from the “target-leverage” view

Incorporating These Concerns

- The irrelevance of financing comes from the fact that existing shareholders (represented by managers) and new shareholders agree on the value of financial claims.

- Everybody agrees on the size of the “pie”

- This ensures that financial transactions have NPV = 0.

- Departing from this framework:

- Inefficient markets

- Irrational managers

- Managers with more information than investors

- Managers prefer to issue equity when equity is overvalued

- Thus, equity issues signal to investors that equity is overvalued

- Thus, stock price declines at equity issues announcements

- Consequently, managers avoid issuing equity

- In some cases, they may even forgo positive NPV projects rather than issue equity

Managers with more information than investors-The Lemons Problem

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_8.jpg)

Suppose that managers have more information about the firm than outside investors. 

Equity financing: Example

Let’s set aside taxes and financial distress

- XYZ’s assets in place are subject to idiosyncratic risk:

- New investment project:

- Discount rate: 10%

- Investment outlay: $12M

- Safe return next year: $22M ==&gt; PV = 22/1.1 = $20M

NPV =  -12 + 20 = $8M

- Should XYZ undertake the project?

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_9.jpg)

150p=0.550p=0.5Assets value

Case 1: Managers know as much as outside investors

- Suppose that XYZ has $12M in cash for investment

- If internally financed with cash, existing shareholders realize the full $8M NPV of the investment.

- Suppose that XYZ does not have the cash but can issue $12M in equity

- Once the project funded, the firm is worth 100 + 20 = $120M

- Raise $12M by selling 10% of shares (after issue)

- Existing shareholders get 90% * 120 = $108M

- To be compared with $100M if did not invest

- Existing shareholders gain $8M

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_10.jpg)

With no information asymmetries, managers are indifferent between internal and external financing

Case 2: Managers know more than outside investors

- Internal financing

- As before, existing shareholders gain $8M

- Equity financing

- Raise $12M by selling 10% of shares (after issue), valued by themarket at 120 (i.e., 100 + 20).

- Existing shareholders get 90% * (150 + 20) = $153M.

- Existing shareholders gain only $3M

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_11.jpg)

When equity is undervalued, managers prefer to finance internally than to issue equity

150p=0.5150p=150p=0.5ShareholdersManagersAssets value from the perspective of

Case 2 (cont.): How about debt financing?

- With debt financing:

- Raise $12M and repay (1.1) * 12 = $13.2M next year

- Existing shareholders get the full $8M because:

150 + (22 -13.2)/1.1  = $158M

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_13.jpg)

When equity is undervalued, managers prefer to finance with debt than equity

Why Is Safe Debt Better Than Equity?

- Its value is independent of the information

- Managers and the market give it the same value

- Safe debt is fairly priced no lemon’s problem

- Risky debt is somewhere “between” safe debt and equity

- There is some lemon’s problem associated with risky debt but it is less severe than with equity

Lemon’s problem: Implications

- If your assets are worth $150M, you will not want to issue equity, but will finance internally or with debt

- If you choose to issue equity, investors will know that your assets must be worth only $50M

- Consequently, stock price will fall when you announce an equity issue

- By how much?

Example (cont.): Market Reaction

- Recall market’s expectations

- Assets are $150 (prob. = ½) or $50 (prob. = ½)

- So currently, assets are valued at $100

- Upon seeing an equity issue, the market infers that the firm is sitting on negative info:

- assets are worth only $50M

- The firm’s market value drops to 50 + 20 = $70 when equity issue is announced and new equity is issued

Evidence on equity issue announcements

-3.5-3-2.5-2-1.5-1-0.500.5-10-8-6-4-20246810Day after announcementCumulative Excess Return (%)

Evidence on announcement effects

- Stock price reaction to issues:

- Straight Debt:Little or no effect

- Convertible Debt:-2%  (9% of proceeds)

- Equity:-3%  (25% of proceeds)

- Stock repurchases:  +13%

Example (cont.): Underinvestment

- Suppose investment outlay is $18M not $12M.

NPV = -18 + 22/1.1 = $2M

- Raising $18M requires selling 15% of shares

- Existing shareholders get 85% * (150 + 20) = $144.5M

- They lose $5.5M relative to $150M if did not invest.

- XYZ will not issue equity to fund project.

Key Point: Investment Depends on Financing

- Some projects will be undertaken only if funded internally or with relatively safe debt

- Information asymmetries can lead companies to forgo good project

- Companies with less cash and more leverage will be more prone to this underinvestment problem

- Issuing safe debt is more difficult at high leverage

- Also, issuing too much debt may lead to financial distress

Pecking Order and Capital Structure

- Basic Pecking Order:

- Firms will use cash when available

- Otherwise use debt

- High cash-flow ==&gt; No need to raise debt==&gt;In fact, can repay some debt

==&gt;Leverage ratio decreases

- Low cash-flow ==&gt; Need to raise debt==&gt;Reluctance to raise equity

==&gt;Leverage ratio increases

Key Point

- If Pecking Order holds, a company’s leverage ratio results:

- not from an attempt to approach a target ratio;

- but rather from series of incremental financing  decisions.

- Contrary to the Target Capital Structure Approach, the Pecking Order implies that capital structure can move around a lot.

Key Point: Timing of Equity Issues

- There may be ''good'' and ''bad'' times to issue stock.

- Best not to issue when lots of information asymmetry --i.e., should issue when price impact of issue is lowest.

Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) 1960-99

Evidence on timing of equity issues

- Firms tend to issue more equity in booms and less in busts

- NPV of investment opportunities are higher, so firms are willingto incur the costs of issuing equity

- In fact, when lots of firms are issuing, the stock price impact of an equity issue is low

- Caveat:Is this because information problems are lower or because stock markets are inefficient --i.e., systematically mispriceequity?

Managerial Behavior and Capital Structure

- So far, we assumed that managers act in the interest of shareholders. 

- But is it always true?

- Conflicts of interests between managers and shareholders are called agency problems

Agency Problems

- Agents do not always do their job =&gt; costs to principals

- These cost are called “Agency Costs”

- They are reflected in a lower share price

- Potential problems:

- Shirking

- Empire Building

- Perks (private jets)

- Risk avoidance

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_19.jpg)

Principals = Shareholders

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_20.jpg)

Agents = Managers

![](images/lecture_08_capital_structure_-_informational_and_dynamic_considerations-b.en_img_21.jpg)

Avoiding Agency Costs

- Compensation policy

- Monitoring managers’ actions

- Independent directors on the Board

- Banks as lenders

- Large block holders

- Market for Corporate Control (i.e. takeovers)

- Can leverage help to avoid agency costs?

A Classic Agency Problem: The Free Cash Flow Problem

- Free Cash Flow (FCF)

- Cash flow in excess of that needed to fund all positive NPV projects

- Managers may be reluctant to pay out FCF to shareholders

- Empire building through unprofitable acquisitions

- Pet projects, prestige investments, perks

- This problem is more severe for “cash cows”

- Firms with lots of cash (i.e., profitable firms)

- And few good investment opportunities

Example of FCF Problems

Evidence from the Oil Industry (Jensen, 1986)

- From 1973 to 1979: tenfold increase in crude oil prices

- Oil industry expanded

- Oil consumption fell

- The oil industry at the end of 1970s

- Lots of excess capacity

- Lots of cash (because of high prices)

- What did managers do?

Example of FCF Problems (cont.)

What did managers do?

- They did not pay out cash to shareholders

- Continued spending on exploration and development (E&amp;D)

- Stock prices reacted negatively to the announcements of increases in E&amp;D by oil companies during 1975 –81

- Invested outside of industry

- Mobile purchased Marcor(retail)

- Exxon purchased Reliance Electric (manufacturing) and Vydec(office equipment)

- These acquisitions turned out to be least successful of the decade

Can leverage reduce FCF problem?

- Debt = commitment to distribute cash flows in the future

- If managers cannot keep the promise to pay interest (principal),bondholders can shut down the firm

- Thus, debt reduces FCF available to managers

- Less opportunities for managers to waist cash

- How about commitment to pay dividends?

- Dividends also reduce FCF

- But a commitment to pay dividends cannot be enforced

Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)

- LBO is a going-private transaction

- Typically, incumbent management acquires all publicly-traded shares

- LBOsare often financed with debt (D/E ratios of 10 are not uncommon)

- Kaplan (1989 JFE) finds in a sample of 76 LBOs:

- Debt / Value went from 18.8% to 87.8%

- 42% premium paid to shareholders to go private

- In three years after the buyout

- Operating Income / TA  increased by 15%

- Operating Income / Sales increased by 19%

- Net cash flow increased and capital expenditures decreased

- Do LBOsimprove efficiency through the control function of debt?

Capital Structure: An Extended Checklist

- Taxes

- Does the company benefit from debt tax shield?

- Information Problems

- Do outside investors understand the funding needs of the firm?

- Would an equity issue be perceived as bad news by the market?

- Agency Problems

- Does the firm have a free cash flow problem?

- Expected Distress Costs

- What is the probability of distress? (Cash flow volatility)

- What are the costs of distress? 

- Need funds for investment, competitive threat if pinched for cash,  customers care about distress, assets difficult to redeploy?
