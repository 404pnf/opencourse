5 Terminal Values • • • →→• Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter In valuing long-lived projects or ongoing businesses, we cannot forecast every year of cash flow forever. Forecast FCF until it is reasonable to think that the project or company is in “steady state.” Typically, assume: either the company is liquidated; or FCF is a growing, flat, or declining perpetuity; Note: The forecast horizon will depend on firm and industry.

6 • • • ∆Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Terminal Value in Liquidation: 1) Salvage value (SV): CF that the firm receives from liquidating its assets SV = Liquidation price -Liquidation costs The firm is taxed on (SV – PPE) so that overall it gets SV*(1-t)  + t*PPE 2) Net Working Capital Recouped NWC at project end (i.e., last NWC = last NWC)

These might differ for several reasons: cannot recoup the A/R fully Inventory may sell above or below book value Note that differences between actual and book value of NWC will have tax implications. Liquidation value tends to underestimate TV unless liquidation is likely. Useful as a lower bound

NA is a good measure of replacement costs. Don’t forget to discount TV further to get PVTV. In WACC method, k=WACC. IN APV method, k=kfor FCF and appropriate rate for TS.

12 Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Economic Value Added (EVA): EVA = EBIT*(1 -t) -k*NA Intuition: Growth is good when the cost of increasing NA is more than compensated by the capitalized increase in EBIT*(1 -t).

13 EVA: Some remarks • implications. • • • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter EVA is a snap shot measure, disregards future cash flow Use EVA as... … a simple measure to determine whether the business is generating value and whether growth is enhancing value. … as a way of setting goals to enhance value. Beware of EVA for... … young companies. … companies in rapidly changing business environments. … companies where book values are not accurate measures of replacement costs.

14 Strengths • • • • • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter DCF Analysis: Pros and Cons CF comes from specific forecasts and assumptions. Can see impact of changes in strategies. Valuation tied to underlying fundamentals. Weaknesses CF only as good as your forecasts/assumptions. Might “forget something”. Need to forecast managerial behavior (unless you’re in control). Need to estimate the discount rate using a theory (e.g. CAPM) that may be incorrect or imprecise in this particular case.

15 • • →• →• →Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Valuation by Multiples: Assess the firm’s value based on that of publicly traded comparables. Cash-flow-based Value multiples: MV of firm/Earnings, MV of firm /EBITDA, MV of firm /FCF Cash-flow-based Price multiples: Price/Earnings (P/E), Price/EBITDA, Price/FCF Asset-based multiples: MV of firm/BV of assets, MV of equity/BV of equity

16 • Hope: • STEP 1: value. • STEP 2: average of comps’ P/E). • STEP 3: Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Procedure Firms in the same business should have similar multiples (e.g. P/E). Identify firms in same business as the firm you want to Calculate P/E ratio for comps and come up with an estimate of P/E for the firm you want to value (e.g. take the Multiply the estimated P/E by the actual Net Income of the firm you want to value.

17 Remarks • →→price-to-subscribers multiples, →• • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter For firms with no earnings or limited asset base (e.g.  hi-tech), price-to-patents multiples, or even price-to-PhD. multiples! For transactions, can also use multiples for comparable transactions (e.g. similar takeovers). Multiples based on equity value (or stock price, e.g., P/E) as opposed to total firm value ignore effect of leverage on the cost of equity (or assume the firms have similar leverage) =&gt; Beware if comps have very different leverage.

18 Motivation for Multiples? • • =&gt;  →→→• Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter If the firm’s actual FCF are a perpetuity: MV firm = FCF/(WACC-g)  MV firm/FCF = 1/(WACC-g) Comps will have a similar MV firm/FCF provided: their FCFs are also a perpetuity they have the same WACC (requires similar D/(D+E)) they are growing at a similar rate Since these are rough approximations (at best), you may want to check if using different multiples give you similar answers. If not, find out why not.

19 Comparables: Pros and Cons Pros: • • • • Cons: • • • measures. • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Incorporates a lot of information from other valuations in a simple way. Embodies market consensus about discount rate and growth rate. Free-ride on market’s information. Can provide discipline in valuation process by ensuring that your valuation is in line with other valuations. Implicitly assumes all companies are alike in growth rates, cost of capital, and business composition. Hard to find true comps. Hard time incorporating firm specific information. Particularly problematic if operating changes are going to be implemented. Accounting differences, particularly with earnings and equity-based Multiples of FCF and EBITDA preferable for this reason. Book values can vary across firms depending on age of PPE. If everyone uses comps, who actually does fundamental analysis?
