## 0 Point Estimation: An Overview 

- We	have a sample from a known family of distribution, but we do not know the parameters θ. 
- -Example: tossing an unfair coin, where P(H) is unknown. 

- We want to use the sample to infer or make a hypothesis about the unknown parameters. 
- What do we do? Choose a function of the sample: estimator/statistic. Note that this estimator is a RV too. 
- However, we could choose inﬁnite functions of the sample... 
- Evaluating (choosing) estimators:-Unbiasedness-Eﬃciency-MSE-Consistency-Asymptotically eﬃcient
- How can we come up with possible estimators? 

-MM (matching moments)-MLE (maximizing the likelihood/probability of observing what was observed)
