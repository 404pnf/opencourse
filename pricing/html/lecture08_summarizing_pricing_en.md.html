<h2>3. 10 Challenges to Pricing Intuition</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If we use cost-plus pricing, we will make a proﬁt </p>
<ul>
<li>Only if you are incredibly accurate with your sales projections </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our customers always prefer low prices </p>
<ul>
<li>Customers will always say they like lower prices. However, in many markets price serves as a guide to quality, and pricing too low can send out a negative signal. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our customers do not know prices, so our pricing strategy is unimportant. </p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of customer price knowledge makes how you present the price even more important. This is where strategies such as good-betterbest and price ending cues are key. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simpler pricing structures are better. </p>
<ul>
<li>You always want three prices. Simplifying pricing structures means giving away money. Due to the taxi-meter eﬀect, customers may not always appreciate it when ﬁrms do price simply. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we are proﬁtable, we do not need to price-discriminate. </p>
<ul>
<li>On the contrary: Price segmentation is actually going to be most eﬀective for already-proﬁtable ﬁrms, because eﬀective segmentation requires the market power implied by proﬁtability. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Razor Blade pricing works because our customers are stupid </p>
<ul>
<li>Razor blade pricing works because it is actually subtle price segmentation. High-value, high-usage customers pay more. Low-value, low-usage customers pay less. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our product has network eﬀects, so we need to set a low price </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your product may well not have network eﬀects at all. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even when a product has network eﬀects, price segmentation is key. The crucial questions for network goods are: Whom do I set a low price to and whom do I set a high price to? </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firms need to adjust prices until I ﬁll capacity. </p>
<ul>
<li>It can be more proﬁtable to have unused inventory or capacity. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Industries need to work together to ensure that they avoid harmful price wars </p>
<ul>
<li>Statements like this lead to jail time. It is the responsibility of the ﬁrm, and the ﬁrm alone, to avoid a price war. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our competitors understand our pricing strategy </p>
<ul>
<li>Firms have to actively manage perceptions of their pricing by competitors, regulators and other stakeholders. </li>
</ul>
</li>
