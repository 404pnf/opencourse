# Session 9 Lecture Notes: 

J. Phillip Thompson and Alethia Jones;  Guest: President of Brazilian non-profit 

## Racializaion and Racial Inequalities: 

Alethia Jones reports on visit to Framingham and walking tour of downtown area with board members of Brazilian non-profit: 

Most of downtown Framingham businesses are Brazilian-owned. Division between North and South Framingham divided by the commuter rail line. Main Street is crossed through by railroad tracks. South Framingham is darker, poorer, more associated with crime. When people talk about “downtown Framingham” they mean the Northern side. White residents in the town don’t feel like the Brazilian-owned businesses are for them, and they want to return to a time when downtown catered to their needs. Commuter train backs up traffic for about a mile when it goes through. Arcade Project is in the middle of downtown adjacent to the non-profit’s headquarters. The project will really need to grapple with parking and traffic issues. 

## Readings: 

The readings tried to differentiate between race and racism and tried to understand the dimensions of how it works in society. Were they helpful in illuminating anything you’ve seen in terms of planning projects? 

In a NYTimes article about the new tactics of white supremacism, the message is including a lot more about immigration: “Think racially. Act locally.” 

In the NYTimes magazine article about Roland Fehrers’ research, the question posed reflected an ideology: the rise of the religious right and the rise of neo-liberalism (everything is solved in the market). He says the problem is either a lack of effort or it is genetic. Paula English, editor of the American Journal of Sociology, wrote an article claiming that blacks are innately inferior to whites based on comparing military IQ test scores between blacks and whites with high school diplomas, controlling for everything else. It makes a radical assumption that high school education in black neighborhoods is the same as a high school education in a white neighborhood (at a minimum). These theories appear over and over and are always discredited. 

Progessive black economists are not household names the way that conservative black economists are.  

## Video: Farmingville. 

Abstract: The shocking hate-based attempted murders of two Mexican day laborers catapult a small Long Island town into national headlines, unmasking a new front line in the border wars: suburbia. For nearly a year, Carlos Sandoval and Catherine Tambini lived and worked in Farmingville, New York, so they could capture first-hand the stories of residents, day laborers and activists on all sides of the debate.  "Farmingville" is a complex, emotional portrait of an American town in rapid transition from a relatively homogenous community to a 21st-century village.
