# 14.23 Government Regulation of Industry

Class 8: Franchise Bidding and CATV 

MIT &amp; University of Cambridge

1

-  Why regulate utilities? 

-  Franchising benefits 

-  Contractual problems 

-  CATV (community-antenna television) 

-  Regulation, de-regulation, re-regulation 

-  Other examples of franchising

- 	Harold Demsetz asks this question in 1968 (borrowing on ideas from Edwin Chadwick in 1859). 

- 	Why can’t there be competition for the field even though only one firm actually produces the good or service? 

- 	Classic example is in defence industry where only one design of tank or plane is adopted. Does that mean Dept. of Defence pays monopoly prices? 

- 	The solution is to have a modified English Auction where the monopoly franchise is awarded to the lowest cost bidder. 

3

- 	Auctioneer announces price at which monopoly service will be offered. 

- 	Determine how many active bidders are around at that price. 

-  If number is &gt;1, announce a lower price. 

- 	Keep going until only 1 bidder is left and the last price is the price at which the service will be offered to the public.

0Q 

5

-  Positives: 

-  Least cost firm wins. 

-  No problem of over-capitalisation. 

-  No informational requirements on regulator. 

-  Franchise owner has incentive to cost efficient. 

-  Negatives: 

-  Price is above least cost, competition is lacking. 

-  As contract is written on price may skimp on quality. 

-  Two-part tariff is more efficient.

P 

Government knows demand curve,

7 MC AC D but not cost curve. Auctions off right to monopoly by giving it to the bidder that maximises social welfare. What is gain in social welfare over linear tariff? 

0 Q0Q1 Q

-  Quality 

-  Not a problem if is this is homogeneous, however it rarely is. 

-  This is a problem if cost and quality are negatively related. 

-  Government will need to specify and enforce quality standards. 

-  Rent seeking behaviour 

-  Multi-dimensional bidding means that it is difficult for auctioneer to work out best bid (e.g. with spectrum actions). 

-  In this case bidders may choose combinations which most interest regulators and do not maximise social welfare -this 

is rent seeking. 

8 

-  Contractual Arrangements (Williamson, 1975, 76): 

- 	What happens when technology or demand changes radically over time? Or costs unexpectedly rise (e.g. due to security costs)?Bounded rationality restricts the ability to write complete contracts. 

- 	Recurrent contracts increasingly give advantage to incumbent who can bid P=AVC to exclude more efficient entrants. This problem can be reduced if capital has to be passed to whoever wins contract but this is difficult to price. Thus there is a hold-up problem where incumbent can over-price assets passed to rival (this represents an entry barrier). 

- 	Incomplete longer contracts (15-20 years) can be used but these are hard to monitor and impose costs of uncertainty on the franchisee. 

- 	Opportunism will always be there as contracting process is costly and embarrasing for government to reopen.

-  A good example of franchise bidding. 

-  1940s: cable used to boost reception of local broadcast services. 

- 	1950s-1960s: introduction of microwave technology allows cable to expand its services by bringing in services from other areas. It thus competes with local broadcasts. 

-  Cable competes with close substitutes: e.g. satellite dishes, videos etc. 

- 	1934: FCC formed and has jurisdiction over wire and radio (including TV). 

- 	FCC refuses to regulate cable on grounds that it is a complement to local broadcast services (improves reception). 

- 	1950s TV industry wants cable to be regulated like them as they are now a competitor. 

-  1962: Importation of signals on cable from distant markets which were

10

available on local television banned. 

- 	1966: Full regulation of cable: required to carry all local TV stations but prohibits importation of additional signals in top 100 television markets. 

- 	1972: Importation freeze lifted but rules still make it hard to import signals. 

- 	1975: Cable takes off with introduction of Satcom 1 satellite which provides cheap long distance signals. HBO wins court case in late 1970s allowing cable systems to compete with local broadcast television. FCC loosens restrictions. 

-  Results: 

-  1971: &lt;33% have cable access; 6% of systems have more than 12 channels. 

-  1980: 50% of systems have more than 12 channels. 

-  1992: 96% have cable access; 90% of systems have more than 12 channels. 

11

-  Required technology: 

-  Headend: antenna which receives signals from microwave relay stations or satellite and processes them. 

-  Distribution plant: uses coaxial cables laid in street to distribute the signals to homes. 

-  Subscriber interface: set top box. 

-  If wires are laid marginal costs of connection are low. 

-  Economies of scale split into econs of density and distance: 

-  Economies of density are significant: penetration increasing from 40% to 80% average cost goes from $14 to $8. 

-  Economies of distance are low: 10% increase the number of homes passed at constant penetration reduces AC by only 0.2%. 12 

- 	Yes, within the local geographic area, not over a wide area. 

- 	Better to have local monopolies with no overlapping service. 

- 	However cost disadvantage of multiple non-overlapping systems not great. 

- 	There may be additional advantages to multiple systems: more potential bidders, more capital market competition and improved monitoring by example (benchmarking).

# Franchise bidding process

-  Municipality announces it will award franchise. 

-  Proposals submitted. 

-  Municipality may negotiate (and impose significant costs). 

-  Municipality notifies select group to submit bids. 

-  Cable companies submit bids. 

-  Municipality selects company (for c.15 years) / calls for new bids. 

-  Process takes 2-10 years (up to 20 years!). •Issues: 

-  No of channels, prices, type of financing, free links to schools, local studios and government channels. 

-  Competitiveness of bidding. Average bidders 5 but declining. CR5 nationally reached 50% (1990) thus collusion likely. 

-  Franchise agreements often re-negotiated ex post. 14 

-  Very few franchisees loose franchise (7 / 3516): good or bad? 

-  1986 Cable Communication Policy Act. 

-  Regulation of rates prohibited. 

-  Franchising continues, no additional entry allowed and renewal easier. 

-  1986-91 prices rise sharply 

-  However, number of channels goes up 30%. 

-  DOJ estimates quality adjusted price goes up 18-23%. 

-  Is this the right way to do this analysis? 

- 	1992 regulation re-introduced via Cable Television Consumer Protection Act. 

-  FCC requires 10-17% reduction in rates.

- 	1996 Telecommunications Act retains regulation of basic cable programming and equipment until cable operators face ‘effective competition’. 

-  Effective competition: 

-  if (1) &lt;30% of households take cable or (2) two cable companies serve 50% or more of households and 15% of those take service from the smaller company or (3) a municipal company offers service to at least 50% of households or (4) a telco offers a video-programming service. 

- 	Basic service regulation based on (Premium channels not regulated): 

-  Inflation, number of channels, programming cost and 17

copyright fees, franchise costs, non-license required upgrades.

# Other examples of franchise bidding

- 	TV licensing (ten year regional ITV franchises for terrestrial television licenses in UK). 

-  Railway (inc London Underground?) and Spectrum franchises. 

- 	Private Finance Projects often involving a franchising process to award a contract to supply a good or service which is wholly paid for by the government: 

-  Refuse collection in local government. 

-  IT management of records (NIRS). 

-  Toll roads and bridges. 

-  Hospitals. –Prisons. 

19

# Case study: UK National Insurance Recording System NIRS-2

-  Largest government IT project in Europe. 

-  Contract replace computerised NI records by 1997. 

-  Contract: 7 year for provision of 15 transactions. 

-  Natural monopoly problem if given to private firm. 

-  Compensation payable for contract loss after 7 years. 

- 	Andersen Consulting win: bid $72m (rival $200m) (Public sector comparator=$526m) 

-  Contract delivered 2 years late 

-  Risk of delay not transferred but very cheap! 

20 

- 	Franchise bidding has been a qualified success in introducing some competition into the provision of monopoly services. 

- 	However difficult to argue that it reduces the regulatory burden. For CATV franchising led to normal rate regulation (with guaranteed renewal) and deregulation. 

- 	Technology (via competing networks) is reducing natural monopoly. 

-  Competition seems effective in keeping prices down.
