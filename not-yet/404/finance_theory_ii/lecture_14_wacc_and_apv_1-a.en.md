3 Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter What Next? • We need to incorporate the effects of financial policy into our valuation models.  Question: How do we incorporate debt tax shields (if any) into our valuation? 

![](images/lecture_14_wacc_and_apv_1-a.en_img_3.jpg)

4 Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Two Approaches: • Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): →Discount the FCF using the weighted average of after-tax debt costs and equity costs • Adjusted Present Value (APV): →Value the project as if it were all-equity financed →Add the PV of the tax shield of debt and other side effects ED E k ED D t1kWACC ED +++−=)( Recall:Recall: Free Cash Flows are cash flows available to be paid to all capital suppliers ignoring interest rate tax shields (i.e., as if the project were 100% equity financed).

7 WARNING!!! • →→This intuition is wrong. • • →→Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter The common intuition for using WACC is: “To be valuable, a project should return more than what it costs us to raise the necessary financing, i.e., our WACC” Using WACC this way is OK sometimes... but “by accident”. Most of the time, it is plain wrong: conceptually, i.e., the logic is flawed practically, i.e. gives you a result far off the mark Discount rates and hence the WACC are project specific!

9 Leverage Ratio D/(D+E) • • →• →→Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter D/(D+E) should be the target capital structure (in market values)  for the particular project under consideration. Common mistake 1: Using a priori D/(D+E) of the firm undertaking the project. Common mistake 2: Use D/(D+E) of the project’s financing Example: Using 100% if project is all debt financed. Caveat: We will assume that the target for A+B is the result of combining target for A and target for B. It’s OK most of the time.

10 Leverage Ratio (cont.) • • →→• • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter So how do we get that “target leverage ratio”? Use comparables to the project: “Pure plays” in the same business as the project Trade-off: Number vs. “quality” of comps Use the firm undertaking the project if the project is very much like the rest of the firm (i.e. if the firm is a comp for the project). Introspection, improved by checklist,...

11 • • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Important Remark: If the project maintains a relatively stable D/V over time, then WACC is also stable over time. If not, then WACC should vary over time as well and we should compute a different WACC for each year. In practice, firms tend to use a constant WACC. So, in practice, the WACC method does not work well when the capital structure is expected to vary substantially over time.

Caveat: Cannot use the interest rate as an estimate of kwhen: Debt is very risky. We  would need default probabilities to estimate expected cash flows. If there are different layers of debt. We would need to calculate the average interest rate.

13 Marginal Tax Rate: t • • • →Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter It’s the marginal tax rate of the firm undertaking the project (or to be more precise, of the firm including the project). Note that this is the rate that is going to determine the tax savings associated with debt. We need to use the marginal as opposed to average tax rate t. In practice, the marginal rate is often not easily observable.

This is our estimate of the project’s In the course, we use mostly the formula for a constant D/(D+E).

As the level of debt increases (but remains relatively safe): A larger part of the safe cash-flows goes to debtholders; The residual left to equityholders is increasingly correlated with the market. Note: If cash-flows were negatively correlated with the market (&lt;0), increasing debt would make equity more negatively correlated with the market and would reduce the required return on equity.

The project requires an initial outlay of $100 million and you forecast before-tax profits of $25 The marginal tax rate is 40%, the project has a target debt-to-value ratio of 25%, the interest rate on the project’s debt is 7%, and the cost of equity is 12%. After-tax CFs = $25 0.60 = $15 million = D/V * (1–t) * rE/V * r0.60 0.07  0.75 0.12 = 10.05% NPV = -100 + 15 / 0.1005 = $49.25 million

23 Adjusted Present Value • • Step 1: financed. • Step 2: Note: • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Separates the effects of financial structure on value from the estimation of asset values. Value the project or firm as if it were 100% equity Add the value of the tax shield of debt. This is simply applying MM-Theorem with taxes APV = Valuation by Components = ANPV

You need the rate that would be appropriate to discount the firm’s cash flows if the firm were 100% equity financed. This rate is the expected return on equity if the firm were 100% To get it, you need to: Find comps, i.e., publicly traded firms in same business. Estimate their expected return on equity if they were 100%

28 Extending the APV Method • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter One good feature of the APV method is that it is easy to extend to take other effects of financing into account. For instance, one can value an interest rate subsidy separately as the PV of interest savings. APV= NPV(all-equity) + PV(Tax Shield) + PV(other stuff)

Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Pros of WACC: Most widely used Less computations needed (important before computers). More literal, easier to understand and explain (?) Cons of WACC: Mixes up effects of assets and liabilities. Errors/approximations in effect of liabilities contaminate the whole valuation. Not very flexible: What if debt is risky? Cost of hybrid securities (e.g., convertibles)? Other effects of financing (e.g., costs of Note: For non-constant debt ratios, could use different WACC for each year (see appendix) but this is heavy and defeats the purpose.

30 WACC vs. APV (cont.) • • • • • • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Advantages of APV: No contamination. Clearer: Easier to track down where value comes from. More flexible: Just add other effects as separate terms. Cons of APV: Almost nobody uses it. Overall: For complex, changing or highly leveraged capital structure (e.g., LBO), APV is much better. Otherwise, it doesn’t matter much which method you use.
