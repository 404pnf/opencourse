Size of the pie = Value of before-tax cashfows But the IRS gets a slice too Financial policy affects the size of that slice. Interest payments being tax deductible, the PV of the IRS’ slice can be reduced by using debt rather than equity.

47 What Does the Checklist Explain? • il• ) • Finance Theory II (15.402) – Spring 2003 – Dirk Jenter Explains capital structure dfferences at broad level, e.g., between Electric and Gas (43.2%) and Computer Software (3.5%). In general, industries with more volatile cash fows tend to have lower leverage. Probably not so good at explaining small difference in debt ratios, e.g., between Food Production (22.9%and Manufacturing Equipment (19.1%). Other factors are also important (more on that later).
