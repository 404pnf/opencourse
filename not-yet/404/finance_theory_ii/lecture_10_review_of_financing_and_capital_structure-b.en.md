Finance Theory II

March 11, 2003

Overview of Financing

Financial forecasting

- Short-run forecasting

- General dynamics: Sustainable growth.

Capital structure

- Describing a firm’s capital structure

- Benchmark: MM irrelevance

- Theory 1: Static Trade-Off Theory

- Theory 2: Pecking Order Theory

- An integrated approach

Note:Throughout we take “operations” as given.

Forecasting a Firm’s Funding Needs

- Question:Given our operations (and the forecast thereof), will we need funding, and how much?

- Short-run forecasting 

- General dynamics:

- The concept of sustainable growth

- Cash Cows and Finance junkies

Financial Forecasting: General Approach

- Need (a model of) the firm’s production function

- Use available data

- Common sense

- Specific knowledge of firm and industry

- Given this model forecast all items in the balance sheet except “funding needs”

- Infer the funding need from identity of Assets and Liabilities + Net Worth

Forecasting: Our approach

- Forecast Assets

- Forecast non-bank liabilities, excluding Net Worth

- Forecast Net Income

- Assume some starting value for Bank Loan = “Bank Plug”

- Forecast interest using Bank Plug

- Forecast Net Worth

- Consistency check: Assets = Liabilities + Net Worth?

- If yes, stop

- If not, adjust Bank Plug

- Recall: All we want are rough approximations

General Dynamics

- Sustainable Growth Rate:  g* = (1-d) * ROE

- Gives a (very rough) measure of how fast you can grow Assets without increasing your leverage ratio or issuing equity

- Sustainable growth rate increases when

- Dividends (d) decreases

- Profit margins (NI/Sales) increases

- Asset turnover (Sales/Assets) increases

- Leverage (Assets/NW) increases

Key Points

- Key Point 0: The concept of sustainable growth does not tell you whether growing is good or not

- Key Point 1:Sustainable growth is relevant only if you cannot or will not raise equity, and you cannot let D/E ratio increase

- Key Point 2: Sustainable growth gives a quick idea of general dynamics: Cash cows (g &lt;&lt; g*) or Finance junkies (g &gt;&gt; g*)

- Key Point 3: Financial and business strategies cannot be set independently

Capital Structure

- Describing a firm’s capital structure

- MM theorem

- Theory 1: Static Trade-off Theory

- Tax shield vs. Expected distress costs

- Theory 2: Pecking Order Theory

- Implications for investment 

- Implications for capital structure

- Pulling it all together

MM Theorem

- MM: In frictionless markets, financial policy is irrelevant.

- Finance Theory 1: Financial transactions are NPV=0. QED

- Corollary: All the following are irrelevant:

- Capital structure

- Long-vs. short-term debt

- Dividend policy

- Risk management

- Etc.

Evaluate the following statements

- Issuing equity dilutes earnings-per-share and thus hurts current shareholders.

- Equity in a levered firm is riskier than equity in an unlevered(but otherwise identical) firm.

- Currently, interest rates are high, so it is better to issue equity than debt.

- Currently, short-term interest rates are lower than long-term interest rates, so it is better to issue long-term than short-term debt.

Using MM Sensibly

When evaluating an argument in favor of a financial move:

- Ask yourself: Why is financing argument wrong under MM?

- Avoid fallacies such as mechanical effects on accounting measures (e.g., WACC, EPS, Win-win)

- Ask yourself, what frictions does the argument rely on?

- Taxes, Costs of financial distress, Information asymmetry, Agency problems

- If none, dubious argument. If some, evaluate magnitude.

Equity

Debt

Theory 1: Static Trade-Off Theory

- Talks about costs and benefits of Debt relative to Equity

- The optimal target capital structure is determined by balancing

![](images/lecture_10_review_of_financing_and_capital_structure-b.en_img_1.jpg)

Note:The theory does not give you a precise target but rather a range, an order of magnitude.

![](images/lecture_10_review_of_financing_and_capital_structure-b.en_img_4.jpg)

Tax Shield of Debt

- Debt increases firm value by reducing corporate tax bill.

- This is because interest payments are tax deductible.

- Personal taxes tend to reduce but not offset this effect.

V(w/ debt) = V(all equity) + PV(tax shield)

- Order of magnitude for PV tax shield

- Constant debt level : t*D

- t = marginal tax rate depends on country, tax credits, etc.

Note:A move that increases firm value will increase equity value!

Expected Costs of Distress: Two Terms

Expected costs of financial distress

=

(Probability of Distress) * (Costs if actually in distress)

Probability of Distress

- Cashflowvolatility

- Is industry risky? Is firm’s strategy risky?

- Are there uncertainties induced by competition?

- Is there a risk of technological change?

- Sensitive to macroeconomic shocks, seasonal fluctuations?

- Etc.

- Use past data but also knowledge of industry.

- Beware of changes of environment.

Indirect costs of financial distress:

- Debt overhang: Inability to raise funds to undertake investments.

- Pass up valuable projects Do I need to invest?

- Rivals become aggressive Do I have aggressive rivals?

- Scare off customers and suppliers(e.g., implicit warranty or specific investment) Do other parties care?

- Asset fire salesAre assets easily re-deployable?

- Are my assets valuable to other firms? (e.g. R&amp;D)

- Who are potential buyers? How many? Will they be cash constrained when I want to sell my assets?

Checklist for Target Capital Structure

Tax Shield:

- Would the firm benefit from debt tax shield? Is it profitable? Does it have tax credits?

Expected distress costs:

- Are cashflowsvolatile?

- Need for external funds for investment?

- Competitive threat if pinched for cash?

- Customers and suppliers care about distress?

- Are assets easy to re-deploy?

- Note:Hard to renegotiate debt structure increases distress costs (Recall Massey’s complex debt structure).

Theory 2: Pecking Order

- Firms general financing choices:

- Preferably use retained earnings

- Then borrow from debt market

- As a last resort, issue equity

- Theory: Info. asymmetry between firm and market makes:

- External finance more costly than internal funds

- Debt less costly than equity (because less info-sensitive)

Implications for Investment

- The value of a project depends on how it is financed.

- Some projects will be undertaken only if funded internally or with relatively safe debt but not if financed with risky debt or equity.

- Companies with less cash and more leverage will be more prone to under-invest.

- Rationale for hoarding cash.

Implications for Capital Structure

- If a firm follows the Pecking Order, its leverage ratio results from a series of incremental decisions, not attempt to reach a target.

- High cash flow ==&gt; Leverage ratio decreases

- Low cash flow ==&gt; Leverage ratio increases

- There may be good and bad times to issue equity depending on the degree of information asymmetry.

- Rationale for hybrid instruments.

What Do We Do With Two Theories?

- Sometimes, both theories will give the same recommendation

- But sometimes, they will differ

- Consider Massey Ferguson:

- Static Trade-off theory ==&gt; Equity issue

- Pecking Order Theory ==&gt; Debt issue

- Two questions:

- Is one theory better at describing what firms do?

- Is one theory better at telling what they should be doing?

But As a Prescriptive Theory?

If firms use Pecking order blindly and ignore static trade-off:

- Cash cows will end up with too little leverage (UST).

- Good news: Never too late to lever-up

- Finance junkies will end up with too much leverage (Massey)

- Bad news: It can be too late to unlever(debt-overhang).

- ST debt is temporary relief but worsens things in fine.

DON'T TALK TO DEERE &amp; COMPANY ABOUT MARKET SIGNALING (from Higgins)

(Please see “Don’t Talk to Deere &amp; Company About Market Signaling” from the course 

textbook by Higgins.)

An Integrative Approach

- Each theory makes a statement about what is first order issue:

- STO: Tax shield and Distress costs

- PO: Information (Price of claims you issue)

- Both theories need not be incompatible:

- Use each when you think they emphasize the right issues

- When getting far away from target, STO type issues dominate

- When reasonably close to target, PO type issues dominate

An Integrative Approach (cont.)

- Establish long-run “target” capital structure

- Evaluate the true economic costs of issuing equity

- What is real cost of price hit vs. foregone investment or increase in expected cost of distress.

- If still reluctant to issue equity:

- Are there ways to reduce the cost? (e.g., give information)

- Will the cost be lower if you issue later?

- Can you use hybrids and packages to get there? But be careful. (Recall MCI might get stuck with too much debt)

An Integrative Approach (cont.)

- Straying from target may be warranted. But, be as systematic and precise as possible about justification --Are benefits from straying plausibly large relative to costs?

- Remember: Lion’s share of value is created on LHS. Don’t want to endanger operations. Beware excessive leverage. Ultimately, business strategy should drive financial strategy, not the otherway around.

- Avoid rules of thumb like: ''Never issue in a down market''; or ''Don't knock props out from under stock.'' These may make sense in some, but certainly not all circumstances.

Conclusion

- The bulk of the value is created on the LHS by making good investment decisions.

- You can destroy much value by mismanaging your RHS: Financial policy should be supporting your business strategy.

- You cannot make sound financial decisions without knowing the implications for the business.

- Finance is too serious to leave it to finance people.

What are likely factors that led to this capital structure?

- In most years, assets grew slower than the sustainable rate

- Retained earnings more than covered the investment needs

- Apex never had to raise outside funds

- A classic “cash cow”

- What explains the high sustainable rate?

- High profit margins and asset turnover offset the mechanical effect of low leverage and the high payout ratios

- Apex management has not attempt to voluntarily increase leverage

What explains the high sustainable rate?

- More uncertainty

- Potential regulation

- Technological change

- More competitive pressure

- Regulation may favor competition in generic drugs

- Apex needs to invest more

- Advances in biotechnology =&gt; more R&amp;D required

- Less internally generated funds

- Patents expire

- Bottom line:Lower target leverage.
