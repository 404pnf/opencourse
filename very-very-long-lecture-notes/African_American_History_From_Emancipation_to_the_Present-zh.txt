Lecture 1 - Dawn of Freedom [January 11, 2010]

Chapter 1. Frederick Douglass' Speech, Delivered to Abolitionist Friends in 1852 [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway: 

"Fellow citizens, pardon me, and allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today? What have I or those I represent to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? And am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits, and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?  Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions. But such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak today? What to the American slave is your Fourth of July? I answer, a day that reveals to him more than all other days of the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass-fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy, a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation of the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these United States at this very hour.  Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the Old World, travel through South America, search out every abuse and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival."

Welcome to class.  Many of you will have recognized Frederick Douglass's speech, delivered in Rochester, New York to abolitionist friends on July 5th, 1852.  Douglass is invited by his friends to come to Rochester on July 4th to talk about the meaning of freedom, the meaning of liberty, the meaning of this great country.  These were his friends.  He refused to come on July 4th for the reasons that you certainly heard in this excerpt--and this is a three hour long speech, I spared you two hours and fifty-eight minutes of.  It's a brilliant speech.  But he refused to come on July 4th, because to talk about independence and liberty to a person who emancipated himself was unkind at best, certainly blind.  But he did come.  He came on July 5th, the next day, and offered and presented one of the great speeches in American letters. Now this course is about the African American experience after emancipation, from emancipation to the present.  Today, however, I'm going to lay the foundation for the course by discussing events prior to the emancipatory moment. 

Now before doing that, telling you some more stories, I want to attend to some course details.  One of the first things some of you may have noticed

[Points at Student]: You can come on down if you want to. 

One of the first things you may have noticed is that there are some people back there, and there's a camera, and I'm mic'ed.  This course is being filmed for the Open Yale Course Initiative, funded by the Hewlett-Packard foundation, one of six courses being filmed this semester.  You are not on camera, unless you kind of walk right in front of me right during lecture, which I kind of hope you won't do.  You won't be on camera, so don't worry about it--and don't try to join me on camera, you know, because I got it just at the right angle, you know, and I don't want them filming my bad side.  Anyway, you just need to know that the camera's there, and really, it shouldn't be a factor in the course at all.  They promise to be unobtrusive. 

Now, I'm not the only one teaching this course.  I'm leading it, certainly, but I'm not the only one that's going to help you understand this experience.  Joining me in this task are seven different teaching assistants, a really quite excellent crew that I'm excited about. I want to introduce them to you rather quickly: Ruthie Gow [ph?] is the head TA. She is getting her PhD in African American Studies and American Studies, working on ethnography, cultural history and school desegregation in the South. Jane Ptolemy [ph?], there's Jane, is in African American Studies and History as well--excuse me, History, studying race, benevolence and religion in the early national period.  Chris Johnson, African American Studies and History, studying gender, migration and migrant politics and radicalism in black diasporas.  Ruthie, Jane and Chris are leading writing intensive sections, and I'll explain more about that in a few moments.  So those three are leading the writing intensive sections.  Brian Distalburg [ph?] in History, is studying 20thcentury US culture and politics, specifically anti-defamation activism by historically marginalized groups.  Anastasia Jones, down there as well, is in History, studying gender and sexuality, mid 20th century US culture.  Lauren Perlman [ph?]--that's like the TA corner.  That's really cute--is in African American Studies and American Studies, studying social, cultural and political geography of Washington DC, with a focus on local civil rights and the rise of black power.  And Madison Moore, in American Studies, is studying the politics of beauty in the American fashion history, currently writing on Somali supermodel, Iman. 

The books for the course--you should have the syllabus, by the way, that was by both doors--the books for the course are at Labyrinth.  The books are also on closed reserve at Bass Library.  There are movies during Week Three and during Week Eight that are not shown in class.  They're shown in the evenings, on probably Monday and Tuesday.  Details on that will be forthcoming, of course.  There is a course website that you can find via the class's server.  In fact, when you go there, that should be the first thing you see.  A note about the website: I will not be talking about it in this class. I will not be referencing it in this class.  The way to make best use of the website--and it's not mandatory for this class--the way to make the best use of it though is on Sunday night, before you come to class, take the time to look at that week's overview.  I'm not even going to promise all the links at the bottom of each page of the overview are actually active anymore.  Read the overview.  You will see in that overview the concept, the core of what I'll be talking about that week.  Also notice at the bottom of that overview page is keywords.  I'll be talking--I talk often about keywords in lectures.  You'll see me reference these later on. You'll find a lot of the same keywords on the webpage, and so you will know coming into class, if you look at this website on Sunday, or on Saturday night, since you're not going to be doing anything else but preparing for this class, you will come in prepared to understand what I think are the most important things to know for that particular week's worth of lectures.  So the website's on the class's server.  It's a tool; it's supplementary. Do take advantage of it.

Course requirements: I mentioned that Ruthie, Chris and Jayne are teaching writing intensive sections.  We have two different types of ways to take this class.  You can take them through writing intensive, and therefore satisfy the distribution requirement in that area, or take them through the, quote, regular route.  They have different sets of obligations, although the course is the same as far as substance.  It's all outlined in the syllabus, but essentially for writing intensive, you'll be writing twenty pages of papers, a midterm paper and a term paper, with drafts along the way.  It's not supposed to be a harder way to do the class.  It's simply a different way, a way to bolster your writing skills.  For the other, for the regular path, you'll be taking a midterm and a two-part exam, fairly straightforward survey course set of expectations, as far as that is concerned.  Now, with that little piece of business out of the way, let me get to the actual substance of the bulk of today's lecture. 
Chapter 2. What does it mean to be American? [00:04:44]

This class is about the post-emancipation African American experience.  It is about American history.  And I hope that point is frankly very obvious, but one never quite understands or can anticipate all of these things. It is about American history fundamentally.  At its course, at its core excuse me, the course is about citizenship, the most important keyword for the entire class.  The course is about citizenship, how one becomes a citizen, what one does to preserve that citizenship.  At its core then, the class asks the question: what does it mean to be American?  Now I will ask this question explicitly a few times in the class, but it implicitly is woven through so much of what I'm going to be talking about. What does it mean to be American? 

Now we started today talking about or listening to an excerpt of Douglass's famous oration from 1852.  Now I want to move backward even further, another eighty years or so, going from a rather well-known document and a quite famous individual to a rather unknown document and to someone who is essentially lost to history.  I want to talk about events in the 1770s.  One quick tangent though: when I was about four or five years old, living near Concord, Massachusetts, my mother would take me on field trips.  She'd try them out on me before taking her first and second graders.  And one day she took me to Minuteman Park. Has anybody been to Minuteman Park?  It's beautiful, right?  It's gorgeous.  Anyway, the site of the start of the Revolutionary War.  So I'm with my four and five year old attention span listening to the tour guides walking through these beautiful fields and meadows.  Afterwards, we were driving around a country road, and I point to these stone walls and said, "Mom, those are like the walls the Minutemen hid behind from those stories."  She said, "Jonathan, those are the walls."  Four or five years old, I mean, I was not really thinking in grand, historical terms.  Life did not exist beyond my four or five years as far as I understood it.  But at that moment, I sort of was astonished that these stories, these fun little stories that I'd been hearing for the pas hour or so, whatever it was, in the tour, were actually true, that something existed beyond my own existence on the planet. 

Looking backwards, I like to think that that's when I became a historian, although I would try to be an orthopedic surgeon and then a lawyer.  That stopped after a couple of weeks of college.  But I can look back and think that I learned something that day, that there was something about--something larger than myself around me.
Chapter 3. The Story of John Jack [00:07:56]

Near the Minuteman Park, there's also a cemetery.  At that cemetery, there's a headstone.  My mother didn't take me on this field trip. I went with other people, and we did charcoal rubbings of headstones in Concord cemeteries.  The story behind this headstone is where I want to start this course, really.  It's a story about a man named John Jack.  It's a story about an individual who certainly understood very well about a sense, the existence of forces much larger than himself determining his life.  The epitaph reads, excuse me: "God wills us free.  Man wills us slave.  I will as God wills.  God's will be done."  That's the opening lines.  I know it's a little bit tough to make out. It's on the course website, by the way, the first week. 

"God wills us free.  Man wills us slave.  I will as God wills.  God's will be done.  Here lies the body of John Jack, native of Africa, who died March 1773, aged about 60 years.  Though born in the land of slavery, he was born free.  Though he lived in a land of liberty, he lived a slave, till by his honest though stolen labors, he acquired the source of slavery which gave him his freedom.  Though not long before Death, the grand tyrant, gave him his final emancipation and set him on a footing with kings.  Though a slave to vice, he practiced those virtues without which kings are but slaves."

It's a remarkable document.  My mother did this head rubbing--this stone rubbing--a charcoal rubbing of the headstone, had it framed.  It hung in my family's house. I walked past this image for about fifteen years before I actually read it.  I'm not saying the guy was bright. I look at the opening lines, about nineteen or twenty years old, and I'm floored.  "God wills us free.  Man wills us slave.  I will as God wills.  God's will be done."  It's astonishing.  Couple of years later, I'm heading to grad school, and I look at the headstone again, and I'm thinking grand thoughts about going to study American history.  And I start reading the epitaph all over again, and I start seeing all these connections, these dualisms, God and man, freedom and slavery.  And so I decided to acquire the headstone.  I took it from my parents' house.  I told them about it once I had it on my wall in my apartment at grad school.  And through my mother's good graces, I still have it.  It hangs above my computer.  It's always, it's always with me.  It is something of a totem. 

Now the story about John Jack I think is even more interesting than the headstone.  So we know that John Jack, certainly not his birth name, a black African, born in the continent somewhere in Africa, a continent with thousands of years history of slavery, still present today of course.  He survives the Middle Passage.  He comes to--and he's born free in Africa but is enslaved somehow--he comes over to what will become the United States.  It's not quite the Unite States. John Jack would never see the United States.  He comes to colonial New England.  Now this point's just important on its surface.  We're going to hear a lot about the South in this class.  If you think geographically about so many of the freedom struggles, the post-emancipation African American experience, they are southern stories.  But don't let yourself be fooled.  Slavery was alive and well in New England, and a lot of the freedom struggles that have happened since emancipation certainly happened up in New England as well. 

Anyway, John Jack winds up in Concord, Massachusetts.  He has, as the saying would have been at the time, "a kind master" who teaches him a trade.  He's a cobbler, works on shoes, and allows him to keep a little bit of every shoe he cobbles.  The amount of money's immaterial.  It wouldn't have been much.  Over time, through his stolen labors, his "honest though stolen labors" as the epitaph says, he acquired the source of slavery.  He raised enough money to buy himself.  He secured his own emancipation through his hard work.  He acquires some land on the edge of town, a subsistence farm, nothing much more than that.  And then we discover that he drinks himself to death.  Between the time of his emancipation--his self-emancipation and his death--he tries to become a citizen of Concord.  He couldn't do it.  He was male, an important criteria.  Check that one off.  He owned property.  Those were usually the two most important criteria.  But because he had been enslaved, he couldn't become a citizen.

Let's think of the moment.  We are on the cusp of the Revolutionary War, in Concord, Massachusetts, the start of the Revolutionary War. You have the citizens of Concord, the white, male property owners in Concord, complaining to the British crown about being treated as slaves.  This is literally their language, that they were being treated as slaves, and this wasn't right.  Somehow these people questing for freedom ignored those people they owned.  The black African slaves in their midst, they were blind to their existence, apparently.  John Jack, though, understood the situation.  He saw what was happening all around him.  He couldn't help but, and who knows why he became an alcoholic, but that might be a good reason.  Anyway, he's drinking himself to death and knows it, and he hires an attorney to put his affairs in order.  It's his attorney who crafts the epitaph here. 

Here's where the story gets even more interesting, I think.  The person John Jack hires to put his affairs in order is a British sympathizer, a Tory.  John Jack got it.  He was going to hire--almost like he's thumbing his nose postmortem.  He wasn't going to be allowed to be a citizen, despite his freedom, in an area that's fighting for freedom, claiming that they weren't citizens, they were slaves in fact, and they certainly didn't know slavery like he knew it.  John Jack understood something fundamental about what would become the United States of America, pretty soon in fact. And the fundamental thing he understood is that you cannot understand freedom, that thing that is at the bedrock of what this country is about, you cannot understand it without understanding slavery.  Freedom and slavery were intertwined, intertwined for the citizens on the ground, intertwined for people like John Jack, Frederick Douglass, of course, and others after.  You could not separate the denial of freedom from the quest of freedom.  That's why the citizens of Concord knew it was so important.  They may not have wanted to have John Jack be a citizen, but they didn't want to be like him. 
Chapter 4. The Linkage between Freedom and Citizenship [00:15:43]

Two hundred years later, after John Jack's attorney produces this epitaph--not quite two hundred  years, let's say one hundred and eighty or so--Ralph Ellison, one of the great writers of the American past, identifies much of the same phenomenon that John Jack must have identified and that John Jack's attorney certainly understood.  And he wrote this brilliant passage.  I'll probably use it again later on in the course.  Ellison wrote,  "Southern whites cannot talk, walk, sing, conceive of laws or justice, think of sex, love, the family, or freedom, without responding to the presence of Negroes."  They are intertwined, linked fate, as it were. 

Now this course is going to spend a fair amount of time examining this phenomenon, the linkage between freedom--not so much freedom and slavery, but citizenship and the denial of citizenship.  And we're going to spend time investigating how this challenge, this problem, this tension, can be located in unexpected places.  We'll turn to primary sources of all types in order to examine this story.  One place is a great example is just in currency, stuff you're carrying--well, we don't carry much in terms of dollars and change any more, it's on credit cards, I suppose, debit cards.  But back in the day, a few years ago, when we all carried cash--the story of a nation's myth is embodied on its currencies. 

These are two examples of Confederate scrip.  I wish I could make them bigger.  They're actually JPEG screen captures.  They really aren't--they pixilate pretty quickly.  But you can see on these dollar bills stories that were important to the Confederate States of America.  A one dollar bill and a ten dollar bill.  And the stories that are important are here, going back one image.  Use my mouse here.  Here, then down here.  What you see is labor and white womanhood, and the laborer you see is a slave.  And I know it doesn't show it very clearly in this JPEG, but the laborer is happy.  The slave carrying the cotton is smiling.  On the other bill, you have white womanhood. You're going to see this is quite a fascinating trope in American history, southern American history: the exalted white woman, especially as it pertains to black men, with tropes of violence, and danger, and sexual predation woven throughout that dynamic.  So on the money that Confederates were handing to one another to exchange goods, you have happy labor, you have exalted white womanhood.  Notions of who belongs, the myths that form our nation states, are all around us.  They're on the money that we carry. 
Chapter 5. The History of the Post-Emancipation African American Experience [00:19:25]

We're going to look for stories like this in all manner of places, and through looking at these stories, we're going to see that the post-emancipation African American experience is several different types of histories.  It's a history of political struggle, no doubt.  An image here of black woman voting, the 1950s I believe, from the same night--and the history behind an image like that is filled with all kinds of political struggle that you certainly have at least a slim awareness of, a glimmer of awareness of.  But on the same night, in the same district, that struggle is embodied by this.  The risk she took in voting were risks that involved her life. 

It's a history of political struggle in this country.  Certainly a history of social protest as well.  You have here an image of women from a group called the National Association of Colored Women, the "upstanding women of the race," and I use that in quotation marks for reasons we'll understand in a few weeks.  Not that they weren't upstanding, but it's a very loaded phrase on purpose.  Marching at the White House in this case to protest the lack of an anti lynching law. "Protect life and liberty!" they're exclaiming.  It's a history of social struggle. 

It's a history, certainly, of social control.  There are some images that don't need much in the way of narration.  I will point out though--I mean actually I don't know the history of the image, but if you look closely, you'll see Spanish language up here in the archways.  I think this actually happens in Laredo, Texas, this Klan rally.  It is also a history of cultural celebration.  We'll spend a few lectures doing occasional close readings of important icons, images, sound clips, movie clips in fact, from the post-emancipation African American experience.  This is one image of a series of paintings by the artist Aaron Douglas.  I'm not going to go into it now, because I will go into it in about a month and a half, I think.  But I will tell you that in this history of cultural celebration, the images that we'll be seeing are complicated, deeply loaded with many different stories in the same spirit of John Jack's epitaph.  The stories are in this image here, and I'll explain it in more detail as we get to it. 

It's also a history of powerful relevance today.  We are being trained, people are trying to train us, to talk about this moment as being a post-racial moment.  I actually think it couldn't be anything further from the truth.  The election of Barack Obama--now excuse me, I got ahead of my notes one section here.  History of powerful relevance today for many of its political and cultural symbols.  Prior to the election of Barack Obama, you have battles over flags, state flags.  This is the state flag of Georgia, had been the state flag of Georgia, flying above the Capitol, on license plates, you name it.  The Confederate battle flag, as many of you know, is a powerful symbol of--depending on your perspective, tradition and heritage or violence and degradation.  There's not much gray area when it comes to the battle flag.  As NAACP organized protests about flying something with the Confederate flag on state property, and southern legislatures refused to back down--Interestingly enough, the NFL, National Football League, has done incredible work in getting rid of the symbols and markers of a segregated past, for fear of threatening boycotts, removing the Super Bowl from say Atlanta, because of the Confederate battle flag.  And. in fact, doing something like this in Arizona over the fact that Arizona did not recognize Martin Luther King Day as a state holiday. The battle ensues over these flags in Georgia, and one option is going to be this flag that incorporates all the different flags from Georgia's past, and this is the final cleaning up as it were of southern history.  Now it's a history of powerful relevance today.  This is a handful of years ago. 
Chapter 6. Local Events in History [00:24:26]

Moving to more local events in history, we can think now about the election of Barack Obama.  Two years ago when I was teaching this class, Obama and Clinton were heading into the Democratic primaries, and I'll confess, I thought Hillary Clinton had this thing locked up.  And then this young senator from Illinois goes on a historic tear.  And as I'm giving the lecture course, I'm like, "Wow, I've got to rewrite the end of my class."  And then during that election campaign, there was the Reverend Wright scandal, and Barack Obama's famous speech in Philadelphia during spring break, which is when I really had to rewrite the end of my class.  After the class is over, he goes and gets elected.  Some of you were here from that moment. 

This is a screen capture from The Yale Daily the next day, after Obama wins the election. There's a moment here of the student carrying one of the iconic images in the Obama campaign about hope, and a suggestion of a new day.  Then again, the suggestion of a post-racial day.  Now I don't want to deny the fact that this is an historical election for all manner of reasons, whether it was Hillary Clinton who won or Barack Obama who won, if a Democrat was to win, it was going to be historic.  I don't want to minimize that.  But I also don't want to buy into the fact that simply because the nation has elected a President who is ostensibly black, and I say that very purposefully--if you think about racial coding, as we get later on in this course, you'll understand better why I say ostensibly black. I don't put any political meaning in that phrase, by the way.  I'm not trying to either prop up or push down Barack Obama's racial affiliations.  But electing a President who's ostensibly black, the nation healed itself.  It found a way to get past its ugly histories and its scars. It was a better place.  It was a more perfect union.  It was post-racial.  But really, was it?  Let's think more locally.  Let's go back to Confederate scrip. 

As it happens, I've been showing the other Confederate scrip for years.  And about a year ago, I discovered that, somewhere in the last couple of years, Yale bought a huge collection of Confederate scrip.  It now has the largest collection in the world of Confederate scrip.  Just one of these things.  [Professor laughs.]  Actually, they are beautiful documents, I mean, beautifully constructed.  So I went up to the numismatic--numsistatic--it's one of the words you don't want to flub, but I just did--collection at Sterling Library and looked at the Confederate scrip.  And I was floored when I saw this image.  I'm like, "Can you scan this for my purposes, please?"  You have happy labor.  You have Lady Liberty.  This is happy labor.  And you have this man. 

Those of you who know the residential college system at Yale, which is all of you, will know that one of them is named Calhoun College.  You will know I'm the Master of Calhoun College, which I think is humorous in just its nomenclature, certainly.  This is John C. Calhoun, one of the great men of Eli, as the Yale Corporation thought through the naming of the residential colleges, the first seven back in 1931 and '32.  They wanted to name the colleges after the great--the great sons of Eli, excuse me.  And they wanted, you know, the greatest Yale alum in the world of arts, in the world of letters, in the world of politics, and so on.  And they decided that John C. Calhoun, an important person, there's no doubt about it: vice-president of the United States, powerful senator from South Carolina--Still revered in that state as one of its great heroes.  They decided that John C. Calhoun was their greatest alum.  There is no financial connection from the name or the family to the college, but this was the logic of 1932, '33, Yale Corporation. 

John C. Calhoun was the architect--although he did not live to see the Civil War, he was the intellectual architect for secession.  He believed in states' rights, an important theme of this course that we'll be talking much more in detail about later on.  And he certainly did not believe that slaves were fully equipped to handle the rigors of civilization. It may sound like kind of a strange sentence construction.  They weren't ready to handle the rigors of being civilized, but this is the language of the day.  I wonder, as I look up in the Master's house living room, or in my office, or in the courtyard--and there's images of Calhoun all over the dang place in the college, I have to wonder what he thinks.  History's rather humorous sometimes, and the ironies can be rather beautiful.  But the phenomenon of thinking about race, or not thinking about race, not talking about race, is with us today.  It is all around us. 

Now thinking about Confederate scrip from quite some time ago, you know we aren't carrying that around in our pockets after all.  How's that a reminder of today, thinking about a decision that some people made in 1933?  That's not today's thinking.  You know, how is this with us today?  Thinking about race is with us today in the astonishing ways that people make their decisions and maintain their blindnesses.  Two years ago, the freshman class at Yale--some of you might be in this room who were in that decision process.  I'm not going to call you out--decided to have for their freshman ball the theme called Gone with the Wind.

Student:  That was last year.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Was that last year?

Student:  Last year.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Last year.  Well, let's just say when I heard word of this decision, I thought it was a very curious decision.  I discovered the more sort of immature, sexually prurient reasons for calling it "Gone with the Wind."  I won't get into those now.  But I also know that people thought it would be nice.  They're aware that the movie Gone with the Wind is complicated.  They thought it would be nice to get dressed up in ball gowns and the cotillion style and go to Commons and have a wonderful time.  The blindness though astonished me.  Getting dressed up for a cotillion might sound lovely.  People can--Yalies can make amazing costumes, but was that really Southern history?  Was that really what happened? Was that what it was all about?  You need to understand, as I was telling the students when I was raising my concerns about this, that in many places where you had this plantation society, people dressed up for cotillions, occupying buildings built by slaves, in many of these places, most of the people were black.  Gone with the Wind kind of erases this history, doesn't talk about it. And the notion that some of the most educated people in the world would fail to understand the connection, or the lack of connection, with Gone with the Wind to our lived experience, is rather breathtaking and rather depressing. 

So I decided, in my next lecture, that as a teaching moment, and read a poem called "Southern History" by the great poet Natasha Trethewey, who was here last semester actually.  Professor Trethewey says this:

"Before the war, they were happy," he said.
quoting our textbook.  (This was senior-year

history class.)  "The slaves were clothed, fed,
and better off under a master¡¯s care."

I watched the words blur on the page.  No one
raised a hand, disagreed.  Not even me.

It was late; we still had Reconstruction
to cover before the test, and ¡ª luckily ¨C

three hours of watching Gone with the Wind.
"History," the teacher said, "of the old South ¨C

a true account of how things were back then."
On screen a slave stood big as life: big mouth,

bucked eyes, our textbook¡¯s grinning proof ¡ª a lie
my teacher guarded.  Silent, so did I." 

Now the purpose of my class is not to stand silent, and I hope you will take with you that same determination. This is a local history, after all. You live in it, whether you live in Calhoun, or whether you happen to live in Davenport or Pearson Colleges who, or where, two years ago, this was spray painted on the walls outside the dining hall: "nigger school." Now I don't think anybody from Yale spray painted this, or "drama fags" across the way at the school of drama.  I don't think for a second anybody at Yale spray painted this. But even though we are at Yale does not mean that we are not in New Haven. Even though we are at Yale does not mean that we are being fed by a population that comes from a dramatically different set of resources than we do, in a highly segregated, de facto to be sure, desegregated, workforce. It is around us, we are subsumed in it, and it is our obligation to learn this history, lest we repeat it. Thank you very much, and I'll see you on Wednesday.
Lecture 2 - Dawn of Freedom (continued) [January 13, 2010]
Chapter 1. Introduction and Recap of Last Class [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Yesterday, Monday's lecture, we were outlining the expectations of the course conceptually and practically.  Conceptually, remember that I started with Frederick Douglass's-- an excerpt from his great speech, "What to the slave is the 4th of July?"  Told the story about how he had been honored, in a sense, by his abolitionist friends to come to Rochester to speak about the meaning of independence, 4th of July, how he refused to do so, because to proceed in that way for a man who'd been a slave and self-emancipated, represented in so many ways the enslaved population of the United States, that to invite him to speak about liberty and independence was "cruel mockery."  We also talked about the ways in which, going back from Frederick Douglass's speech in the 1850s, going back to the 1770s with the epitaph on the tombstone, about the ways in which freedom and slavery intertwined, if you're trying to understand this country's history, and the way that citizenship and non-citizenship are intertwined.  I want to pick up on some of those same themes today, and we are going to be lingering for the most part of this lecture just prior to the start of the Civil War.  I'll offer a few--I mean scant details chronologically about the Civil War, and end up with the New York City draft riots, happening in the midst of the Civil War.  And so this lecture is really our jumping off point, from a chronological perspective, for this course.  And as you see, by the end of the lecture, some core themes, again that are articulated on Monday, are going to be brought back into focus by the end of this narrative. 
Chapter 2. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper Poem: ¡°Bury Me in a Free Land¡± [00:01:48]

So I want to begin today's lecture with a poem by the journalist, activist, underground railroad host to those slaves escaping towards freedom--She would open her doors to them.  Woman's rights activist, anti-lynching crusader, woman by the name of Frances Ellen Watkins Harper.  It's a poem written in 1854, the same moment that Frederick Douglass is castigating his abolitionist friends about their understandings of freedom, and of liberty, and of slavery.  The poem is called Bury Me in a Free Land.  And I want you to listen.  It's not--I'm not going to say the poem is high art.  It's better than I can do, but it's not high art, I don¡¯t think.  But think about the images that are crafted in this poem.  It's sort of the psychological terror represented in this poem as well. Bury Me in a Free Land.

"Make me a grave where'er you will,
In a lowly plain, or a loft hill;
Make it among earth's humblest graves,
But not in a land where men are slaves.

I could not rest if around my grave
I heard the steps of a trembling slave;
His shadow above my silent tomb
Would make it a place of fearful gloom.

I could not rest if I heard the tread
Of a coffle gang to the shambles led,
And the mother's shriek of wild despair
Rise like a curse on the trembling air.

I could not sleep if I saw the lash
Drinking her blood with each fearful gash,
And I saw her babes torn from her breast,
Like trembling doves from their parent nest.

I'd shudder and start if I heard the bay
Of bloodhounds seizing their human prey,
And I heard the captive plead in vain
As they bound afresh his galling chain.

If I saw young girls from their mother's arms
Bartered and sold for their youthful charms,
My eye would flash with a mournful flame,
My death-paled cheek grow red with shame.

I would sleep, dear friends, where bloated might
Can rob no man of his dearest right;
My rest shall be calm in any grave
Where none can call his brother a slave.

I ask no monument, proud and high,
To arrest the gaze of the passers-by;
All that my yearning spirit craves,
Is bury me not in a land of slaves."

Chapter 3. The Missouri Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska Act [00:04:30]

Again, 1854.  Although the literal start of the Civil War is seven years away, this was an era when it was clear to people like Frederick Douglas and Frances Harper and so many other individuals, free and not free.  This is an era of incredible tension in the country, and really the handwriting's on the wall as the country's barreling towards its sectional crisis.  As early as 1820, the political battles had begun with the Missouri Compromise, an attempt to balance the number of slave states and free states.  The Missouri Compromise angered the South because of the way the federal government intervened in this process.  You're going to hear this often in this course.  The tension between federal government initiatives and states' rights initiatives.  Who has greater authority, the federal government or the states?  Fundamentally important to the post--or to the African American experience, pre- and post-emancipation. 

So in 1820 at the Missouri Compromise, balancing free states and slave states, so neither would have an advantage in the federal government when it came to setting policy about labor in particular.  Fast forward, 1850, the Compromise of 1850, essentially the same issues as in the Missouri Compromise.  It's relating to territory gained in the Mexican-American War.  What part of the United States is going to be free versus what part is going to be--or what states are going to allow slavery.  One of the most important texts in US history, novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin, is published in 1852, written by Harriet Beecher Stowe.  Quite a long time before Oprah's Book Club, the book sells in numbers that are astonishing.  Three hundred thousand copies of this text are put into print, and eventually, over a million copies are sold. This is in 1852.  It's--the numbers are sort of incomparable to today.  The importance of the book is that it galvanizes through this sort of very romantic and treacley novel.  It reads very--it's an interesting read in our contemporary ears.  But it galvanizes so much of Northern opinion about slavery and, frankly, helps pull this country apart, looking backwards. 

In 1854, you have the Kansas-Nebraska Act, that wipes out the Missouri Compromise of thirty-four years earlier and starts a bloody war, essentially a civil war within Kansas about whether we're going to have slave territories--slave states or free states in these areas.  Out of the battles in Kansas, the Republican Party emerges.  It didn't exist before.  And it would become the party that was most sympathetic to the African American experience--African Americans' interests in becoming free and having citizenship rights.  It becomes the party with which blacks would affiliate until nineteen--the mid-1930s.  Now this takes us up to around 1857.  Again, I'm fast forwarding through a lot of history here, just to get to some of the main themes of this lecture.  So the country is being ripped apart through a variety of federal and state legal battles about where people can be free and where they cannot, what states can support slavery, recognize it as being legal. 

During all these battles, a court case is winding through the system, a legal case, and it's finally decided in 1857 by the Supreme Court, Scott v. Sanders, more famously, the Dred Scott case.  Now it's a complicated case, which I'll reduce to its simplest forms.  It's a complicated case that revolves around travel, essentially.  North of the line thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes related to the Missouri Compromise and the battles in Kansas and Nebraska, north of that line, the country is--these are free states.  South of the line, you're in slave holding territories.  Dred Scott lives on both sides of this line.  He's a slave.  Sorry if I didn't make that part clear.  He's a slave and lives with his master and his mistress on both sides of this line, on and off over the course of much of his life.  And for much of a decade, he's living in free territory.  When his master dies in 1846, Scott sues for his freedom on the ground that he had been living in free territory. 

"You can't own me,I've been living in a place that doesn't recognize that status." So he sues in court.  The courts go back and forth until the Supreme Court issues the final decision in 1857.  Eleven years have transpired since the original suit.  And in the course of these cases--these decisions going back and forth, Dred Scott and his family, if you can imagine, have been emancipated, re-enslaved, emancipated, re-enslaved, depending on the court's decision.  He's living a life in a terrible--I mean a limbo that we really can't imagine.  Well the Supreme Court weighs in and solves the matter once and for all.  Chief Justice Roger B. Taney writes a decision that is quite notable. He says that Scott should remain a slave, that by virtue of his slavery, he is not a citizen of the United States, and so could not bring suit in a federal court in the first place.  He wipes out the whole process.  "You were never a citizen, because you were a slave. You didn't have the right to sue." 

Moreover, Taney says, that as a slave, he was personal property, and personal property can never become free.  We think of personal property as inanimate objects.  Certainly African American slaves were not inanimate, but for Taney it didn't matter.  That's a gray area, I mean if you could call it a gray area, that for Taney, that was a gray area that was really reduced to something simple: They were personal property; they could not become free.  Adding insult to injury--I mean the decision gets just better and better from the standpoint of raising one's bile--Taney makes plain his opinion of blacks.  "They were," he offered, and this is a quote, "so far inferior that they had no rights which a white man was bound to respect."  "They were so far inferior that they had no rights which a white man was bound to respect."  So in one decision, he eliminates even the chance, from a legal standpoint, that you could sue if you had been a slave.  He says that's not even a possibility.  Furthermore, you're property and you weren't free ever, and now we shouldn't even respect you anyway, because you're so far inferior. 

Taney's decision, building upon the legislative battles of the previous thirty-seven years at that point, building upon the tension that's exacerbated, I suppose, might be the right word, with Uncle Tom's Cabin.  Taney's decision helps move the country closer to Civil War because it infuriates anti slavery advocates.  On so many levels of his decision, he has made the wrong choice, philosophically, ethically and legally, according to anti-slavery advocates.  The new Republican Party which was opposed to the expansion of slavery--now notice, it's the expansion, not wiping it all out.  Things take time. The Republican Party, which is opposed to the expansion of slavery, criticized the decision.

There's a postscript to this. In 1857, we don't want to lose sight of Dred Scott himself.  Scott's mistress, his master's widowed--widow, Dred Scott's mistress remarries and gives Scott and his family their freedom.  Now why she couldn't do this eleven years earlier is a mystery that, you know, only she could answer, I suppose.  But she gives him and his family their final freedom.  And if you remember the epitaph from Monday, I mean the painful, bitter irony of the whole process, just like John Jack.  Not long after he buys his freedom, he dies. One year after Dred Scott finally gets his freedom, an eleven year battle in the legal system, one year later he dies from tuberculosis.  It's a bitter coda to a life of struggle. 

So Dred Scott dies in 1858.  Steadying--Continuing this March, 1859, John Brown, former principal of a seminary where Frances Harper, whose poem I read to you earlier, the principal of the seminary where Frances Harper worked, becomes an evangelizing zealot against--or for anti-slavery causes.  Slavery is inhumane. It's unholy, according to John Brown, and he recognizes--or he believes the way to solve this problem, since the legal process isn't working, since the process of moral suasion isn't working, is to get guns.  John Brown organizes a band of armed abolitionists, black and white men, and their plan is to storm the arsenal in Harper's Ferry, Virginia.  John Brown invites Frederick Douglass.  "You're such an important leader for African Americans.  You need to join us in this battle." And Douglass says--I mean, I wasn't there for the conversation, but--"John, you're crazy."  And he may have been a bit, well, visionary I suppose is another word for crazy in sometimes.  He forms a group, John Brown does, and they begin their raid.  Doesn't last very long.  Robert E. Lee, general in the United States army, not yet a traitor, quickly defeats John Brown and his associates.  Brown is wounded in the battle and he's captured, and in short order, he's convicted of treason, and he's ultimately hanged. 

Between the time of the raid, or when he's caught that is, and his hanging, there's a trial.  And during that trial, John Brown becomes seen as a messianic hero to many people.  Frances Harper, again, has a note sent to John Brown when he's in prison that reads in part, and I'm quoting from it here,

"In the name of the young girl sold from the, excuse me, In the name of the young girl sold from the warm--warm clasp of a mother's arms to the clutches of a libertine or profligate, in the name of the slave mother, her heart rocked to and fro by the agony of her mournful separations, I thank you, that you have been brave enough to reach out your hands to the crushed and blighted of my race, I thank you."

Brown himself fanned the flames of celebrity during the trial with long soliloquies, all to no avail.  He's going to be hung.  Some of his last famous--his famous last words.  He declares, "I believe that to have interfered as I have done on behalf of this despised poor, I did no wrong, but right."  To the end, he was quite certain his path, armed resistance, was the solution to a country that could not figure itself out on this issue, whether it be a slave holding country, non-slave holding country or some strange mix. 
Chapter 4. Abraham Lincoln and Slavery [00:18:01]

John Brown's raid in 1860, Abraham Lincoln's elected in 1860.  Simplifying a complicated story, but essentially, the South has no electoral presence in the election, and it felt that the Union was doomed, and Southern states begin to secede.  April of 1861, the Civil War starts.  Lincoln wants to preserve the Union at all costs, and tries from the very start to lure the South back in with a plan of compensated emancipation.  Essentially, "We'll pay for your slaves.  You emancipate them, we give you some money."  Many people in the North balk at this idea.  This is crazy.  And the South completely refuses.  Lincoln tries to develop a colonization plan to move blacks to Latin America.  Now this is part of a longer tradition.  Lincoln didn't just create an idea of like solving the race problem by getting rid of the race.  This has been going back to this point through colonization societies, thirty, forty, fifty years, and then in terms of individual ideas, much longer. But Lincoln thinks, "Well this is a solution. We've got a problem with slaves.  Slaves were black in this country."  There's also Native American slaves, but a much smaller population.  "We'll just move them."  That plan doesn't work out either. 

Now Lincoln has an evolutionary viewpoint when it comes to slavery, in terms of its role in society, pragmatically, how it affected the Union, the sustainability of the Union, or the possibility of reconciliation of the Union.  He doesn't support slavery, but he could not find a way to eliminate it, and try to preserve or reconcile the Union.  Political and pragmatic pressures finally force his hand.  Congress had already begun to chip away at slavery by refusing to allow captured slaves to be returned to their bonded status.  And with just a little over a year after the Civil War begins, Lincoln essentially throws up his hands.  He goes, "There's really no--there's no way to solve this problem," and decides that emancipation is going to be the solution.  How are we going to do it?  What's it going to look like? 

By the end of the year, he's drawn up the plans and enunciated the policy and on January 1st , 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation takes effect.  Now the proclamation is a fascinating document.  It's compromised, as most political things are.  It's a manifestation of compromise and it declares that the slave population in any state that's still in rebellion against the United States on January 1863--slave populations in those states that are in rebellion against the federal government, against the United States, at that moment would become free.  Now what does this mean?  It means, curiously, not much in a practical sense. 

If you're in South Carolina, you own slaves.  Your state had seceded from the union.  Lincoln says on January 1863, "You don't own those slaves anymore."  Well, if you're in South Carolina, you don't care what Lincoln says.  You still own your slaves.  In Maryland though, which sided with the Union, if I had a plantation that owned slaves and I was in Maryland, my state is not in rebellion against the U.S., I still own my slaves.  Now slavery in Maryland is different from slavery in South Carolina on the level of type of slavery and also scale of it.  So in terms of literally freeing people, the Emancipation Proclamation doesn't.  It is still one of the most important documents in the history of the United States, because when you think of politics, there's the literal effects and there's the philosophical or cultural, symbolic effects.  You think of the Emancipation Proclamation in that way, it is an astonishing document.  The Civil War, the debates go on to this day. The Civil War, was it a war about slavery?  Was it a war about just different economic systems?  Was it a war about political philosophy?  And people still argue themselves blue in the face.  But what is clear is that at the moment of the Emancipation Proclamation, the Civil War does become about slavery.  Even if you were fighting it for some other reason, the stakes are very real, that if the North wins, if the Union wins, slavery will be abolished from the United States. 
Chapter 5. New York City, the Irish and the Freed Slaves [00:23:42]

Now let's head towards these last sort of 20 minutes of the lecture.  We're going to stick North for a while here.  Now the war is about slavery, at least in this sort of cultural politics of the moment.  It's a miserable war.  The South and the North are beating themselves up to a pulp certainly, and Lincoln faces a problem.  The Union troops face a problem.  They don't have enough people. And as we head through the winter of 1863, Lincoln decides he has to try to find a way to raise the number of troops that are available to fight in these wars--in this war, and you had the Conscription Acts being passed, and they're going to take effect in March of 1863.  And what the Conscription Acts say is that there's mandatory military service for men who are between age twenty and forty-five unless--and there always seems to be an unless when it comes to conscription--unless they happen to have three hundred dollars on them.  If you had three hundred dollars, you could buy yourself an exemption.  It's a long history of that in this country, and many other places.  The history is still with us today.  Political leaders bought their exemption.  It's called--you know it's called, "Daddy's a powerful political figure.  I will not go to war." 

Conscription Acts of March 1863 said if you were between twenty and forty-five, and you were a man, you had to serve, unless you could find three hundred dollars.  Well, three hundred dollars is a huge sum of money, 1863, so no surprise the wealthy gave their money, and they were exempt.  Most of the country wasn't wealthy.  This was a way to raise troops and also raise money.  They needed both.  There was an unintended effect. I don't think you would have been a surprise, but it was an unintended effect.  It exacerbated class tensions within the country, within the Union, I should say.  So as you're heading into spring of 1863, the battle is still going on. Young men are dying left and right.  The war, what is this war about really?  Who is it for?  It's about emancipating these black slaves.  And you head into March and you had these Conscription Acts taking place.  "Now I have no choice but to go."  Then you head into the summer and these tensions, wondering what the war is about, not having the resources to get out of risking one's life, for something you're not sure if you even believe in.  Class tensions exacerbated.  In New York City, all of these different tensions combine and essentially combust. 

What's going on in New York in particular? In addition to those things I just mentioned, in New York, there are labor tensions.  Really dramatic labor tensions.  The Irish immigrant population treated horribly for quite some time.  The Irish control the docks.  The Irish are already struggling with local blacks for that bottom rung on the ladder.  Who's going to have a chance to get a purchase on that bottom rung and to start to pull themselves up?  And the Irish dock workers control this--these important ports in New York City.  Horrible, dirty, messy, dangerous job, but we're not going to let blacks take this job.  So there's tensions in labor ranks in terms of who can actually be the laborer to start to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.  There is a fear adding to this labor tension, has an ethnic and racial aspect to it--there's a fear now that since January of 1863, since Lincoln freed the slaves, these slaves are going to end up in New York City.  How they're going to get there is, you know, another issue, but there's going to be a fear--there's a fear of a flood of emancipated blacks coming up to New York to find work.  And let's face it, these folks had nothing.  They'll take any job, was the expectation. And so the Irish dock workers felt even further antagonized by the fact of job insecurity and the fact that this other, these black folks, were going to take their jobs. 

Now as I said before, the Irish, many of them are brand new to this country.  They're scrambling to secure their own place as citizens in this country.  Looked down upon, treated terribly by other groups.  And they believed, aside from wanting to keep these jobs, that their claim to citizenship rested in part at least upon the fact that they were not black.  This is a very important point.  It's not that it's just about a job, but about belonging.  Irish treated--like there'd be signs in the stores, "No Irish or dogs allowed in."  Blacks already weren't allowed in.  No Irish or dogs.  The Irish were treated horribly, and so they realized, as long as they are not like "that person," "those people,"--that person, those people being black.  Having been emancipated, whether they were actually ever a slave or not, they are--they are tarred in a sense with that same label, from an enslaved people.  People who weren't citizens in many people's minds. The Irish workers say, "Well, at least I'm not that, so I'm moving up the ladder." 

So you take emancipation, you take the Conscription Acts, which are certainly affecting the Irish more than any other population in New York City, you take the fear of emancipated blacks coming up and taking jobs away from the Irish dock workers, and it makes it plain that the Irish now feel incredibly compromised.  Everything they had fought for might be in danger of slipping away.  Their freedom, as I mentioned when talking about John Jack and citizens of Concord in 1773, Irish workers' freedom was incumbent upon blacks' slavery.  They're intertwined.  Now we're into July of 1863, after setting all this stage. 

On July 11th, a first lottery is held for conscription.  So we've had this plan, now we're going to make it real.  And within two days, mayhem ensues.  Now New York is a port city.  So aside from having the dock workers unloading material goods and products, or loading them onto these ships, you have troops that are being rallied from different places in the Northeast that are coming down to New York City, or they're leaving from New York to head further south into the military battles, into military stages,  scenes.  And so there's all this tension around the military being there.  And now, with the Conscription Acts really becoming--well becoming real, people are going to be forced to don the uniform. 

Several days of rioting begin. The military command--commandant of the region, anything embodying military, or suggesting police control, is targeted.  So the commandant is sought out.  Soldiers are sought out, police are sought out.  They're targeted by these gangs, largely ethnic gangs, largely Irish gangs.  They're the ones who felt most at threat.  And these gangs also targeted blacks.  The call went out from the commandant, "We need more troops."  Now it takes a couple of days, during 1863, to get people there.  After a few days, military troops are brought in to the city to restore calm.  When the dust has settled, as many as a thousand people are dead during these riots. 

Anybody from New York City?  There's got to be a couple of people here.  Well, think of these places: on the West Side, Twenty-Seventh and Seventh Avenue, West Thirty-Third Street, Thirty-Seventh and Seventh Avenue.  On the East Side, Thirty-Fourth and East River--a very specific street--address, One Hundred Forty-Seven East Twenty-Eighth Street.  All of these sites that you have--you've walked around them, I know you have, these are sites of lynchings in New York City. We're not talking about gangs throwing rocks and beating each other up.  We are talking about lynchings, in addition to that as well, I should say.  In total, eleven people are lynched during the several days of riots.  A few examples: Joseph Reed, separated from his mother and grandmother, he's beaten to death.  He's seven years old.  William Williams, a sailor, assaulted by the longshoremen, the dock workers, when he asked for directions, not knowing this riot is happening. Someone picks up a cobblestone, hurls the stone at him.  Someone else stabs him.  The crowd cheers, and they start chanting--And I'm sorry to use the language always.  You'll be hearing it several different times in the course, but this is just the history of it all--start chanting, "Don¡¯t hire niggers!  Don't hire niggers!"  Labor and class all intertwined, certainly citizenship as well. 

The Colored  Orphanage, a very large building there to take care of abandoned children, the crowd sees this place as a site of threat--I guess you'd say it's threat, but something given to blacks that the Irish didn't have the benefit of.  And they decide they're going to set the orphanage on fire.  Thankfully, word gets to the orphanage in time, and they were able to escape out the back as the building is torched.  So the Colored Orphanage is burned to the ground. One story is particularly illustrative, not a happy story of course.  On the third day of riots, Abraham Franklin, a disabled black coachman, and his sister Henrietta, were pulled out of their boarding room.  Now there's one thing I forgot to mention that's important, thinking about this particular setting.  Blacks and Irish were sort of--were at each others' throats through this process, but they're living in the same areas.  They're interacting all the time, and that's what makes this story that much more horrific in a sense. 

Many Irish--I don't want to paint entire groups--many Irish and blacks got along perfectly fine, and certainly commingled in every way that you can imagine that way being used, happily, passionately, or angrily, you name it.  But they were living in the--these were their own neighborhoods.  Abraham Franklin and his sister Henrietta are pulled out of their boarding room.  Henrietta is beaten while Abraham is hanged.  Federal troops, who are now coming into the city trying to quell the riot as it moves to different places, federal troops arrive, and they cut down his body.  It's too late to save his life.  Troops break up the crowd and then disperse, heading off to another flashpoint.  The rioting crowd re-hangs the body, and they start chanting.  Just as you had William Williams being murdered to chants of "Don't hire niggers," inflammatory declaration, in Abraham Franklin's case, you have chants coming out from the crowd, inflammatory in a different way.  They re-hang his body to chants of "Jeff Davis! Jeff Davis"  What does this mean?  They're praising the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis. 

So you have Irish workers, living with other African Americans certainly, feeling threatened that their citizenship is at stake, deciding to take our their threat, and feeling they might be conscripted into the military, likely would be.  They decide to take out their anxiety, fears, and anger on the Colored Orphanage, on seven year old boys, on sailors, on disabled black coachmen.  And they're going to honor the idea of keeping people out of unions.  "Don¡¯t hire niggers."  And they're going to honor, curiously, the presidency of the Confederacy--president of the Confederacy.  So Abraham Franklin is hung, body cut down.  He's re-hung--re-hanged, excuse me--and then later on, after the crowd disperses to do something else, somewhere else, a sixteen-year old Irish butcher cuts down Franklin.  Maybe his body will finally be put to rest.  No, in fact the butcher decides to drag his body through the streets as a trophy, in so doing, I claim, marking his own claim to citizenship on the dead body of a black--of a crippled black man. 

Now what's the point of all this narrative?  The point of this is that we can see in the crucible of the Civil War a very clear picture of what it means to be a citizen and what it means to be American.  A foundational question for this class, as I mentioned in Monday's lecture.  Douglass questioned the sanctity of July 4th, that great cultural marker of freedom.  "Why would you bring me here, representing a people who only know slavery?"  Harper, the poet and journalist, activist, makes clear how blind people were to the psychological anguish of slavery, children being torn from their mothers' breasts.  The Dred Scott case is explicitly about who could be a citizen of the United States.  Taney didn't think any slave could be a citizen.  They're too inferior and they're property.

The political turns made out of necessity, and this is very important, made out of necessity in the Civil War, made it absolutely plain to people like Abraham Lincoln, who starts to decide to change these policies; made it absolutely plain that citizenship was going to be linked to freedom, and that freedom was linked to race.  The connection is certainly there in terms of social, cultural forums.  It's there in political forums.  It is tangible.  As soon as he signs in to being the Emancipation Proclamation, and in the fallout through the Conscription Acts and the New York City draft riots, it is real.  Citizenship is linked to freedom; freedom is linked to race.  The tensions between all of these linkages are made really quite perfectly clear by those people who are rioting in New York City.  And, I really think, made abundantly clear when Abraham Franklin was dragged through the streets of New York by his genitals.  Thank you very much.  I'll see you on Friday.
Chapter 1. Introduction: The Reconstruction Era [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  

"I know the nigger. The employer must have some sort of punishment. I don¡¯t care what it is, if you'll let me tie him down by the thumbs, or keep him on bread and water, that will do.  All I want is just to have it so that when I get the niggers onto my place, and the work has begun, they can't sit down and look me square in the face and do nothing." 

Mississippi planter to a Freedman's Bureau official. The language is what the language is. "Let me find some way or give me some way that I can punish these people so they¡¯ll do the work that I need them to do."  We can see in this quote how politics, labor, and free will are intertwined. These are the themes for this week, this week being beginning of the second week of lectures, although we're meeting on Friday. We'll be looking at the way politics, and labor, and free will are in the mix, as it were, throughout this particular era. We're moving this week from the very end of the Civil War, 1865 to about 1877. Well, at least for this lecture, excuse me, the period known as Reconstruction. Now when thinking about Reconstruction, the general attempt by the Union or by the United States to bring the Union back together, when we think about Reconstruction, it's really important to understand that we're talking about an evolving set of ideas, an evolving set of political strategies. Now I'm simplifying things when I say it, there's no doubt about it, but there is a real element of improvisation during this era, an experimentation as the country, at the federal level to the most local level, is trying to figure out how to heal the wounds of division.
Chapter 2. Chronology of the Reconstruction Era [00:02:12]

I want to map out for you the basic chronology of this era and then we'll be, I'll be moving forward in this chronology and then working backwards again back to 1865. So November of 1864, Lincoln's reelected. By April of 1865 he's assassinated. Before he dies, however, and after his reelection, he starts working on plans to complete emancipation. He had already made the proclamation, the Emancipation Proclamation, in 1863, but he was concerned that after the war there might be attempts to see or to interpret the Emancipation Proclamation as merely a wartime resolution and not something permanent. And for Lincoln the die has been cast now. He's gotta find a way to make emancipation permanent. And so he starts working with Congress and other individuals for the passage of what would become the Thirteenth Amendment for the Constitution--to the Constitution. The first of three so-called Reconstruction Amendments.

The Thirteenth Amendment abolishes slavery. Again, making sure that the Emancipation Proclamation is more than just a wartime measure, that it would emancipate those people who are legally still kept as slaves after the Emancipation Proclamation. So looking directly at this slide, you're going to see Lincoln's assassinated in 1865. Excuse me.  At the end of 1865, The Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery is passed. You enter into phase of Presidential Reconstruction followed by Radical Reconstruction. Then you have the two other Reconstruction Amendments, the Fourteenth, establishing the lines of citizenship and guaranteeing due process, the Fifteenth Amendment, guaranteeing the right to vote that would not be mitigated based on your race or previous inservitude, and by 1877, withdrawal of Northern troops, the end of the Reconstruction. I want you to get this down in your notes so you understand the chronology that I'll be going back over for the rest of this particular lecture.

So Lincoln's reelected, he's building a plan, advocating a plan that would turn into the Thirteenth Amendment, calling for a complete end of slavery in the United States. Things aren¡¯t looking good for the South. It seems that the North is going to win the Civil War.  Even before Lincoln's assassinated, he seems pretty certain that¡¯s going to be the case. And so several central questions, now that the tide has turned in this way, simply have to be addressed. And these are the questions that are really the--I'll be spending the lecture addressing. And the questions might seem kind of strange to you, but as you'll see, they're rather relevant to the ways in which whites and blacks are responding to this new era in U.S. history.

"What does one do with blacks now they¡¯ve been emancipated? How will they be controlled?" I use that language very intentionally. "Who will do the work and how will the South survive the upheaval?" What I want to do--this is an incredibly complicated era, and I've always been struggling with the right way to tell this story. What I want to do for the rest of the lecture is tell the narrative mainly from a standpoint of high politics, electoral, formal processes and legislatures, for instance, and then I want to go back over the same time period looking at the social history, what's sort of happening on the ground. So it's giving you the heads up, we'll be looping back over--going back to 1865 and starting over in a sense, looking at these different narratives to address these questions. "What do you do with blacks, how are they going to be controlled, who will do the work, and will the South survive the upheaval?"
Chapter 3. A Narrative Account of the Reconstruction Era [00:06:37]

Now before Lincoln is killed, he starts trying very aggressively to figure out the best way to reunite the country after the war. He proposes a ten percent plan. It's called "The Ten Percent Plan." And it is a--the elements of the plan involve a pardon to all Southerners, except for Confederate leaders, they could not be excused. A pardon would be given to all Southerners who took an oath of loyalty to the Union and supported emancipation. Once ten percent of a state population, we're talking white males, once ten percent of the state population agrees to this idea, signs this loyalty oath, a new government could be formed. Anti-slavery activists, Congressional radicals, people are just staunch supporters of the Union efforts saying, "This is way too lenient, we have spilled too much blood just to say if ten percent of the South goes along with this plan, everything will be forgiven." The plan goes nowhere, and Lincoln is assassinated.

Andrew Johnson takes office and develops a plan and a series of measures that taken together are capturing what we call "Presidential Reconstruction." The basic terms of Presidential Reconstruction say that a general pardon is given to the white South, except for Confederate leaders, just like Lincoln's plan, but Johnson's is different. He says, "We will pardon everyone except for Confederate leaders and wealthy planters." Johnson was a man of the people, coming from farming roots, working very hard, and saw that moneyed land-owners, plantation-owners, were a real source of many of the problems in the South. So the pardon to the white South, except for Confederate leaders and wealthy planters, required the end of slavery, and then it would let the South set up it's own governments. And the thinking was that the white yeoman farmers--since the white planters, the wealthy planters, would not be allowed to be the leaders, that white yeoman farmers, people working sort of hand-to-mouth and scraping by, they would be the one who would take control of these governments and restructure the society more along sort of I would say agrarian class sympathetic lines.

Plan moves forward, and Johnson could not have been more wrong about what would happen. He thought that there would be a new egalitarian ethos in the South, and what happened is that once the whites take over office, they begin to answer the set of questions I posed at the beginning of the class, in terms of what to do with blacks, with a rather curious set of answers. They enacted the so-called "Black Codes." I'm going to skip over the Black Codes for the moment, save that for the social history part of the lecture. But they enact the Black Codes. The answer under Johnson that the white governments in the South provide does not look a whole bunch better than slavery for many African Americans.

The Republicans in Congress, people who've been staunch anti-slavery advocates, are horrified at Johnson's plan. Lincoln's was way too lenient, Johnson's was stricter, but it didn¡¯t change the social order, as it turns out. And so Congress, the Republicans in Congress, they now control the Congress, sets about fighting Johnson at every turn. Johnson has a plan, Congress overrules it. Johnson vetoes Congress's decision, Congress beats back the veto. I mean, the government is just locked in this battle at the federal level on all manner of issues. During this period of federal inside battling, I suppose one could call it, Republican-controlled Congress pushes through the first Civil Rights Act in 1866, it pushes through the Fourteenth Amendment delineating the terms of citizenship and due process. Due process is something you'll be hearing--being incredibly important for freedom struggles as we move forward in this class. And threatened--the Congress threatens South's representation in Congress if blacks were denied the right to vote.

Southern states, seeing the handwriting on the wall about the fact that Republican-controlled Congress, which is a Northern Congress, sees these terms and just rejects them. Congress gets tough and ushers in a series of reforms that become known as "Radical Reconstruction" or "Congressional Reconstruction," they are the same thing. Congressional Reconstruction and Radical Reconstruction.

Student:  <<sneezes>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Bless you. So Johnson has a chance to make a difference in Reconstruction. From 1865, with Lincoln's assassination, to 1867, that two years of experimentation. Congress says, "Forget about it, we're taking control here,"--through sheer numbers--and enters the longest phase of Reconstruction, Congressional Radical Reconstruction, from 1867 to 1877. And it is a radical change. Under this new Reconstruction plan, the South is divided into five military districts. These districts are controlled by Northern and Republican governments. There is quite literally a military occupation of the South by federal troops.

Congress pushes through the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870, guaranteeing blacks, and this is black males, please understand, guaranteeing them the right to vote. If you'd been a slave, it doesn¡¯t matter. If you're black, it doesn¡¯t matter. You have the right to vote. After this amendment passes, you start seeing a period in the eras of different Reconstructions, of incredible positive change for many African Americans--not all, but many. And that change often comes through--you can mark it by the dramatic increase--well, increasing from zero to anything is dramatic, I suppose, but the dramatic increase of blacks holding office. You start seeing black men holding office at the local level, being elected to maybe a town council let's say, in some places being located the local sheriff, which is really quite astonishing, through state governments and into the federal government. In Congress, and in the House of Representatives, and in the Senate. 

The change in representation that there are blacks in government at all levels is astonishing on many levels. What is even more astonishing, I'll repeat this fact in about ten weeks or eleven weeks, is that the number of black elected officials in the federal government, House of Representatives and Senate, blossoms during this era, at the end of Reconstruction, which I'll start talking about in the next lecture, that those numbers start to evaporate, and the numbers do not return as far as federal representation of blacks coming from the Southern states. It does not return until Bill Clinton is elected President. This is a radical change, and it is so radical it could not be sustained, as we'll see. But for the moment, in 1870 through 1877, at the level of politics, electoral politics, it seems there is a real opportunity for change as far as representation--the local, the state, the federal level. All of these changes, federal occupation--military occupation of the South, setting very aggressive terms about how the Southern governments could be reformed and readmitted to the Union, having blacks hold elected office, all of these changes tear at the social fabric of the South.

What I want to do for the next bit is to start looking at these changes sort of on the ground. Trying to help us understand the ways in which things had shifted fundamentally for whites and African Americans at the moment of the end of the Civil War. Now as I eluded earlier to the question "What are you going to do with blacks?"--The central question of the era is what one does with blacks springs out of the fact that freedom meant different things to different people.

Freedom meant liberation for blacks, and that part is obvious certainly. For whites, at that moment of liberation, those who had slaves from small, you know, small slaveholding households, two or three slaves to plantations, it means an immediate loss of labor. For blacks and whites it means an immediate sense of profound instability in the social fabric. In a very curious way, it means for blacks in more dangerous situations--dangerous moment. Slaves' bodies¡­

Professor Jonathan Holloway: [laughs] It's alright.  Okay.  Slaves' bodies had value, literal value. You were property. If you did something--if someone thinks you did something wrong, black person offends a white person's sensibilities, and a white person decides to strike me, hit me, hurt my body or something, that white person has damaged property that belongs to somebody else and they had to make restitution. After the end of the Civil War, black bodies were, from a financial standpoint, they had no value. Now I remember actually making this statement during a public lecture at a library during a series of lectures in San Diego and someone got very upset with me. Everybody has value.  I mean yes, everybody does have value, but I'm talking of literal dollars and cents. Black bodies don¡¯t have value after the moment, the end of slavery, and you can do what you want to with them. Freedom, you can't discount it's important for African Americans, the moment of liberation. But profound instability you can't ignore either.

Now since the Southern economy is devastated after the war, during the war and after the war, since there's the loss of labor that is profound, white planters want a quick return to plantation labor, you gotta get crops in from the field. And they understood that we don¡¯t have slaves anymore, but there's gotta be a way to get gang labor reorganized, have an overseer. At the same time black--white planters want this, blacks who have been working on these plantations for example, they¡¯ve gotta find a way to put food on their table, but they want to have economic autonomy, be it land ownership. They want to have their own farms. White farm-owners want blacks to sign labor contracts to commit themselves to work on the farms. Blacks reject this saying they expect the federal government to help them out. They expect the federal government to redistribute land. So you have these really intense conflicting expectations that are directly related to conflicting senses of what freedom meant. And if you look at some of these items on the screen here, I'll start talking about them, you'll start seeing where these expectations come from and why they would be so conflicted and complicated.
Chapter 4. 1865: The Establishment of Black Codes [00:20:12]

Now we're back in 1865. Johnson is the president and he wants to see the Southern economy back on track and wants blacks back to work immediately. The question is how to do it. He allows Southern governments to reestablish themselves under Presidential Reconstruction guidelines, and once they do, a lot of these white governments start answering the question what to do with blacks and establish Black Codes. Now Black Codes were a series of state-level laws aimed at answering the question what to do with this newly freed population. There was one--there wasn¡¯t a single set of Black Codes, they ranged broadly. Some are more strict than others, but they are just taken together a series of legal concepts that are seeking to create a new labor system that essentially put blacks back to work.

Now you look at the codes, you'll see they authorize blacks to acquire property, something blacks certainly wanted. It authorized blacks to marry, something they were not allowed to do when they were slaves. It authorized blacks to make contracts, sue and be sued, testify in court against other blacks, mind you. All of these things are essentially brand new, so the Black Codes on the surface, at first glance, seemed to be a way of trying to give blacks some citizenship rights they didn¡¯t have before. But look a little more closely, you'll also see many other guidelines that make it clear that the Black Codes are about labor stabilization.

Now I'm lumping all of these things together here. Some state codes required all blacks to have an annual proof of one year labor contracts. Basically you had to sign up saying, "I'm going to work this plot of land at this plantation, I'm going to work in this shop for the next year, and I won't leave." If you leave the job, you sign that contract, you leave the job before the year is up, you will lose all wages that you had earned up to that point. And you might be subject to arrest by a white citizen. And notice, I'm not talking about the white Chief of Police or Deputy, be arrested by a white person walking down the street who says, "You know, you're not working the way you should be working. You clearly should be on that labor contract, and what are you doing here?"

Some Black Codes would say that blacks couldn¡¯t steal labor or else they risked a five hundred dollar fine, I mean a ridiculous amount of money. Now stealing labor, that could be interpreted as not working hard enough. Or that could be interpreted as when you're working this plot of land, saving a little bit of that part for yourself. Not maximizing the return on the investment, essentially, that white property-owners had made. If you steal labor you could be fined five hundred dollars. In other states blacks were forbidden to rent land in urban areas. The notion was if you have them closer to a city, you might have critical masses developing of African Americans who are property owners, or at least renters. They might be able to develop their own economic opportunities through informal networks, essentially allowing blacks to rent property in towns gave them too much autonomy, the fear was.

Black Codes forced black women back on farms. This way they would not be seen in public spaces. This was all for the good of the woman, this is for the black women, they should really be in their natural habitat. This would've been the language of the day, by the way. Black Codes regulated sexual behavior. You could not dress a certain way, you could not be out at a certain hour. Black Codes would address vagrancy, idleness, rude gestures, mischief, preaching the Gospel without a license and so on. I mean, incredibly vague. If you're just kinda hanging out, you could be in violation of a Black Code. If you're up to no good, being mischievous, violation of a Black Code. And all of these could lead to fines or involuntary plantation labor.

Black Codes forced apprenticeships on black minors--black young people, not miners, minors. They would have to work without wages. It's mainly orphans or children of poor parents. Many of the Black Codes said that they could--blacks could not hunt or own weapons. This is a very important limitation, because in the rural South, you shot your food. But the idea was, "If we start giving blacks guns, they may not shoot food, they may shoot us." So blacks can't hunt or own weapons. So you take all these things together, and again, I've lumped many different state's Black Codes here, it's clear that while everyone wants the Southern economy back on track, I mean everybody does, there's no rational way of justifying doing it via the Black Codes. And so fairly soon after their being established, sometimes in less than a year, these Black Codes are declared illegal and are eliminated. So we're talking about a very--a brief moment in time. This sort of underscores the notion of we're at a period of improvisation and experimentation, "We'll try this until we're told it doesn¡¯t work any longer."
Chapter 5. Sharecropping: A New Labor System [00:26:14]

In the place of the Black Codes, a new labor system develops. This one was much more focused--much more explicitly focused upon labor instead of all the morality issues that you see in the Black Codes. And this new labor system, that becomes incredibly successful for what it was, is called sharecropping. Sharecropping revolves around credit. The whites own the land, the tools, the seed, but they didn¡¯t own the labor. That¡¯s what blacks controlled. So blacks could use the land, the tools, and the seed, but they did not get paid in cash. Instead they would rent the white's property and their tools, etcetera. And in order to get the seed, they'd have to go to the company store for their purchases. And the store would be sort of like Durfee's, you know, exorbitantly priced.

Students:  <<laughs>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  So, you know, if a bag of seed on the market--I'm making up the numbers here, might have cost one dollar, at the company store maybe it's three, three credits, three units, or something like that. So sharecroppers would pay for their food, their seed, etcetera with their shares, their portions of the crop that they were growing and later harvesting for the landowner. At the end of the year when the crop in question, let's just say it's cotton, which it would've been for a tremendous amount of the system, when the cotton is taken to market, the cotton that black sharecroppers had planted and harvested, they would not be able to go to market with the cotton crop. The landowner would go there, or his business manager, and he'd sell the cotton at the market rate. Then he would come back and make a declaration of how much he was able to get for this, settle the accounts privately with the landowner, and the landowner and labor then settled their accounts. And then a funny thing happened.

Almost inevitably, at the end of the year, after the planting cycle, when the crop came--was sent to market--and they came back with the money for it, they looked at the balances, and blacks owed money to the sharecropper, Every year. Let's just say, again making up numbers, that if I'm a sharecropper and I spent a thousand dollars at the company store to buy all the--rent the equipment or buy the seeds or whatnot for my plot of land, I get this amazing crop, it goes off to market, come back, and the guy said "You know what? I was only able to get nine hundred dollars." I now owe a hundred dollars to the landowner. What this meant was I'm stuck, because it is illegal to skip out on your debts. So the sharecroppers are required to go back to work for the same person in an attempt to eliminate the debt. So you have another--and the cycle just keeps repeating itself, you never get out of debt, you're always working the land. What this meant is that, you know, maybe you aren¡¯t being whipped by an overseer, but you are in perpetual servitude, as far as your labor and debt is concerned, to the landowner. You can't escape it. Sharecropping works like a charm. It really begins in earnest in the mid-1860s or the later 1860s, it is still popular in the South through the 1940s.  Only with systematic mechanization of farms do you have sharecroppers being relieved of that particular economic cycle.
Chapter 6. The Freedmen¡¯s Bureau [00:30:04]

So white attempts to answer the question of what one could do to get blacks back to work, revolved around various attempts, whether it's through the Black Codes or the sharecropping system, they revolved around various attempts to get--to recreate slavery, but with a different name and a slightly different nature. As I mentioned before, black--I mean, thinking about freedom from the black's perspective also meant labor instability. This is why the Black Codes are so Draconian, this is why there's such emphasis on you can't escape debt. This was a way to control blacks. Now remember, blacks had expectations too after the Civil War was over. They wanted their freedom, they got their freedom in the literal sense, there's no doubt about that. But there were also expectations about land ownership, that they would have land they could work themselves, and there were expectations the federal government would be the entity to help blacks navigate their arrival to full citizenship rights and property ownership. And these expectations grow out of The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, and out of Field Order Fifteen.

The Bureau has established, The Field Order's enunciated, Black Codes enacted, all at the same moment, so these are overlapping narratives. Expectations about land, access to it, grows from Union General Sherman's seemingly apocalyptic march to the Sea, in which he burned his way through and across the South, and while doing so issued the famous Field Order Fifteen, which declared that in part--declared in part that coastal land between Charleston, South Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida was from this point on for blacks. If Congress had accepted this promise, or acted upon this promise, excuse me, it would've given over land to roughly about two hundred thousand African Americans. The Field Order, declared in 1865, doesn¡¯t redistribute land, but there is the expectation that the government is going to do so through the likes of violence perhaps, with General Sherman, or through an orderly attempt at giving assistance, and that¡¯s through the Bureau of Freed Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, more often known as the Freedmen's Bureau.

The Freedmen's Bureau was established in March, 1865. It takes a while to get itself up and running. It's organized under the General--the Union General Otis O. Howard--that¡¯s why Howard University's named after this man, he gave his land to the university. The Freedmen's Bureau had the task of providing food, shelter, and medical aid for the destitute. That¡¯s blacks as well as whites. It had the duty of providing education for freed people. To say that there was an educational system for blacks is ludicrous up to this moment in time. It's also kinda ludicrous after the fact, but they were working on it. The Freedmen's Bureau establishes free labor arrangements in former plantation areas. Essentially it's charged with trying to help blacks develop an economic system where they could sign to do work and contract, but they had freedom in doing so. And the Freedmen's Bureau is charged with securing justice for blacks in legal proceedings.

The Freedmen's Bureau record on this front is mixed at best. You know from Field Order Fifteen that it's the potential of returning or giving all this land to blacks doesn¡¯t really happen. Freedmen's Bureau, they're talking about, you know, famous "Forty Acres and a Mule" ideology. The Freedmen's Bureau is in control of, at one point, eight hundred and fifty thousand acres of property, that instead of being transferred to poor whites and to blacks, is transferred back to the original property owners. So these white planters lost their land in the war, and after some sorting out, they got their land right back. The notion of establishing wage labor contracts, that blacks are not going to be working for a year like in the sharecropping system that would've developed, but they would be paid wages, doesn¡¯t work. So the Freedmen's Bureau doesn¡¯t distribute land like it promised it would, fails in establishing wage labor contracts. But it does do something really remarkable in that it starts establishing schools. Now again, these schools would not be on par with white schools, not by a long shot. But again, when you start from zero, any change is a radical change. So from 1865, the moment it was founded, to 1869, three thousand new schools for blacks, these are shacks essentially, are established.

So the Freedmen's Bureau seems to at least on one level be doing something right, making a real change. But by 1872, it's gone as well. It collapses. So it leaves us with a mixed record. The record of Radical Reconstruction, in fact, for much of the 1870s is mixed. The North is growing increasingly weary of Southern intransigents, incredible resistance to these kinds of changes. Southerners are tired of the Northern presence and were angry at having new state constitutions written under Republican-controlled governments that, as far as white Southerners were concerned, gave away way too much in terms of the rights and citizenships to black men. This period of sorting out, of radical changes at the electoral level that are highly positive for African Americans, there's no debating that, that are of mixed success on the ground for the great majority of African Americans--but clearly it's better to be free than slave, despite all the dangers that are incumbent with it.

It is a period of incredible stress, and resentment, and of different ways in which whites try to assert control. "What are we going to do with these blacks? Whose going to control them?" One of the first answers was the establishment of The KKK, The Ku Klux Klan, established in Tennessee in 1866. You didn¡¯t need the Klan prior to emancipation, but as far as many whites were concerned, you needed something like the Klan after. Klan members would go after white Northerners who were holding elected office, would threaten them with assassination and assassinate some of them, would go after, you know, Jews and Catholics, and certainly went after blacks as well. Klan forms in 1866, but remember this is a period of military presence from the North and the South, and under General Grant, the Klan is wiped out within two years. For a while. But even though the Klan is wiped out, you can see through this era, 1865 to 1877, rising tides of resentment, chaffing by white Southerners, rising tides of--I guess one might just say impatience by black Americans in "When are we going to have real change?" And real change did come, but not in the way that African Americans had hoped.

In 1876, it's the Presidential election, the two men left standing are Samuel Tilden, the Democrat, and Rutherford B. Hayes, Republican. Tilden wins the popular vote, but not-- the electoral vote was unclear because the results from the Southern states were so contested. Sounds like recent history in fact. A compromise though is reached, that Hayes, the Republican, would secure the Presidency, but only if he promised to withdraw federal troops from the North--excuse me, from the South--end the military occupation, let the Southern states all come back into the Union. Hayes accepts the deal--the North again was exhausted by all the struggle. And with this famous compromise of 1877, Reconstruction ends.

Now with the end of Reconstruction, we get a new period of American life generally referred to as "Redemption." When the white South shall rise again, they will redeem themselves. And I'll be talking about Redemption in the next lecture. But I want to turn now from a moment of high politics--or discussion of high politics and a discussion of social history, sort of life on the ground, to take a moment to look at some other types of--some primary sources that helps us understand what I'll just call "the Political Culture" of the moment.

Very famous image, "What miscegenation is. What we are to expect now that Mr. Lincoln is reelected." Talking 1864 now. I mentioned in the first lecture, you know, nation states declaring their cultures, and the ideologies, and their myths on their currency. Well, you can see it as well in political posters, certainly political cartoons. And this is a--represents a kind of theme we're going to see a fair amount in this course. Just like the currency of exalted white womanhood.  And in this case, a caricature, a very dark-skinned caricature of an African American man. Caricature as being of black males, as you probably already know and will certainly know more, very alive and well during this period and certainly even to today in different ways, something we'll talk about later on in the course. But a broadside talking about "This is what we're going to expect now that Lincoln's been reelected. All hope's been lost. White women and black men will connect in this sort of way."

Now this one I think is interesting 'cause often the notion is that black men are assaulting white women, but in this case, you have--her arm is wrapped around, not in seeming protest. Be that as it may, the notion of black and white mingling in this sort of way was a profound threat. This is 1864. Now I talked about the Freedmen's Bureau and the work that it was assigned to do. It's there to establish wage labor contracts, and try to help navigate land redistribution, it seemed at first, and try to help provide basic assistance and education to African Americans. Well, on the political campaigns in 1866, after the Freedmen's Bureau has been established, you start seeing representations--again another very famous poster. Representations of what Reconstruction actually means, the Freedmen's Bureau, or what--excuse me, the Freedmen's Bureau means. "The Freedmen's Bureau, an agency to keep the Negro in idleness at the expense of the white man, twice vetoes by The President and made a law by Congress. Support Congress and you support the negro, sustain the President and you protect the white man."

Another caricature of an African American in tatters, 'cause he doesn¡¯t really need to be dressed so he doesn¡¯t really care, barefoot, idle, happy as can be. The white man looking on, working very hard, trying to earn his keep, do the right thing. Now, aside from this being a very famous poster, sort of capturing the sentiment or resentment about the Freedmen's Bureau being there to assist the lazy African American, this is also important to highlight the ways in which these narratives appear in surprising places and ways, or at least, ways that we today might think are surprising.

This is a campaign ad, not in Alabama, not in Mississippi, but in Pennsylvania. It's an ad sort of regarding an election in 1866 pitting John Geary, Republican, against Hiester Clymer for the governorship of Pennsylvania. Clymer's saying, the Democrat, is saying, "If you support Geary, you're supporting this. Black idleness." From the same campaign--and this is dramatic I think, pretty dramatic as well, but you see the notion of caricature and ideals of white beauty but in a different sort of way in the same campaign, another broadside. Pretty direct here. Clymer's platform is for the white man. Geary's platform is for the Negro. Read the platforms. Again, if you're supporting Geary, represented here by the grotesque representation of a black male, if you're representing Geary, you're representing all of those things that are wrong about excess, idleness, illiteracy, sexual aggression, all of these things that are associated with black male, especially in this case, black male behavior. If you support Clymer, you support someone whose educated, whose refined, whose disciplined.

So we go from this image, which is sort of a grotesquery, very busy, lots of different texts and representations, to this one that¡¯s cleaner as it were, more upfront about his representations, to in 1868--these are typical, these are not exceptional advertisements. In 1868 in the Presidential--Democratic Presidential Primary--New York Governor Horatio Seymour who was the Governor of the state during the New York City draft riots and who did not pursue the draft rioters, the Irish who burned parts of the city and attacked and killed people and attacked the military, he didn¡¯t punish them, which--and he's a Republican now, and people thought that he was a traitor to the Union army---or to the Union--in support of the Confederacy.

Anyway, New York Governor Horatio Seymour is running with Francis Blair from Missouri for the Democratic nomination. And they announce their ticket, couldn¡¯t be more simple. Our motto, "This is a white man's country, let white men rule." So you see a range of images here that have been popularly distributed. Pennsylvania race for Governor, Presidential primary, again a northern Governor, in this case represented on the Presidential part of the ticket. A language, a visual language, and sometimes just flat-out words of course, making it clear that this era of transition is not an easy one, that there's intransigents in all different corners and all different regions from different perspectives.

And if you're thinking I'm over-reading these things, let me just show this last image that sends a message to Northerners who are coming down to save the South, take over the South, occupy the South--carpetbaggers, people who would load up their things in a bag from the North, come down to the South and set up a government, set up a business and take advantage of Southern resources, certainly a lot of them did. The South had an answer for these people, and you would see posters up on, you know, plastered onto a tree or a wall that would simply say this.

This is the nature of this visual conversation, if you will, of this moment in time, a period of tremendous sorting out, a period it seems of incredible possibility and hope, as far as the elected realm is concerned for African Americans, a period much more complicated on the ground for African Americans and for poor whites certainly, a period of growing or sustaining intransigents by white elected officials in the South, and a period where white elected officials in the North aren¡¯t quite certain about this whole period, this whole idea of trying to reconstruct the Union along these terms. The answers that I posed at the beginning of the class were answered--the questions I posed at the beginning of the class were answered through these narratives. And we'll see some more answers when we resume class the next session and talk about Redemption. Thank you.
Lecture 4 - Reconstruction (continued) [January 20, 2010]
Chapter 1. Billie Holliday Song: Strange Fruit [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  I'm going to start playing a song. This lecture is taking us from the end of Reconstruction, 1877, canvassing an array of events that actually go up to the, well to the present day in certain ways, but in a recorded way, in an official way, until the 1960s. But we will--So from a phenomenological standpoint, we're talking about a large period of time. From a literal standpoint, for this lecture, we're really talking about the 18--end of Reconstruction to the end of the 19th century. And with that, I want--I want to play a piece of music that's actually from the era of the Great Depression, but it's in reference to the time period we're talking about right now. And if I can figure it out while you're listening to it, I'll get the lyrics up on the screen as well.

[Billie Holiday]  And now I'd like to sing a tune. It was written especially for me. It's titled Strange Fruit. I really hope you like it. <<sings>>

Southern trees bear strange fruit,
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.

Pastoral scene of the gallant south,
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh,
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for the tree to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter crop.

Chapter 2. From Reconstruction to the Rise of Redemption [00:03:35]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Many of you, some of you, I don't know, might recognize this as one of Billie Holiday's, the great blues singer, one of her, her most famous pieces, wrote by--not by her, but becomes one of her signature pieces for much of her career, Strange Fruit. Well, I don't think it needs elaboration in terms of interpretative potential of those lyrics. It's a song about lynching, and violence, and the Southern nature of it, the scent of Magnolia trees and such.

Now you'll recall from the last lecture how I talked about the massive cultural shift that Southerners had to endure under Reconstruction government. White Southerners very notions of freedom, the very notions of labor, who's to do the work, and of politics, who's running their states, all these were turned upside down in the most fundamental ways. Though remember as well, at--nearing, nearing the end of the 1870s, the North is exhausted by Southern intransigence. South is digging--is continuing digging--to keep its heels dug in, and a deal is brokered, and a presidential dispute, a presidential election, that essentially withdraws Northern troops, Federal troops, from the South, ends Reconstruction, and then gives the chance to--for the South to reorganize itself fully within the Union.

Historians refer to this moment, this era that begins at that moment, as "the Rise of Redemption."  So you have Reconstruction followed by Redemption. Now Redemption in this is a word that needs to be understood, understood as a fully complicated and loaded phrase. Who's feeling redeemed, and redeemed on what terms?  It's really important to understand that when I'm talking about Redemption, when most people talk about Redemption, they're talking about the white South rising up and taking control of what was rightfully theirs. We're talking about the while male South as well, and we're talking in different ways about the wealthy South and the poor South, the white poor South, and I'll, I'll map this out in the course of today's lecture. We are not talking about at all a constructive or positive era as far as the African American experience is concerned.

Now during Reconstruction, as I hope I made clear in previous lectures, deep seated anxieties take root among Southern whites about economics, about states' rights, and this is a very important couple of words here for today's lecture and for this week's reading as well. There's anxiety about economics and states' rights, but also about manliness and civilization. Manliness and civilization, really critical words. So much of Redemption in this era is about reclaiming--about whites trying to reclaim that which they thought was lost during Reconstruction and that which they thought was under attack. A perfect example of an attempt by, or an articulation by, Southern whites about how they are going to redeem themselves--redeem the South--from the scourge of the Northern presence, is the fact that as soon as the Federal troops leave, essentially, the KKK, which had been wiped out by the military, Northern troops, soon after it was established, the KKK reemerges with a vengeance.

But it's not the only group being formed in this moment of Redemption. There are other groups. You don't need to know the names for your--for the purposes of the class, but just know there were other organizations, like the Knights of the White Camellia, the Constitutional Union Guards, the Pale Faces, the White Brotherhood, and the Council of Safety. The last name is kind of interesting, because it's not one of these sort of grandiose, mythical kind of names, not Council of Safety. Who's feeling threatened?  Under what terms?  How will we establish safety?  So any number of nativist and racist hate groups that are being formed in this moment of cultural anxiety, I guess is the most polite way to put it, cultural, economic, social anxiety in the white South and a determination to reclaim it on its own terms.
Chapter 3. Forces used to Eliminate the Black Vote [00:08:47]

Now when Republican government's faded, once the Federal troops left, when they faded in the wake of a resurgent Democratic party, which is a Southern party, this at the end of Reconstruction, a range of tactics start being developed to guarantee the return of white power. So it's not just that the Federal troops left, the government's collapsed, whites were all of a sudden in control. It wasn't that quick and that easy. It was actually dirty and messy. Crops that were owned and tilled by blacks were destroyed. Blacks' homes, their barns--which is an incredibly important part of the infrastructure in the South--their homes, their barns and other property were destroyed, were burned, as well.

If blacks tried to exercise the right to vote, black men, and go to the election booth, and if it is deemed by someone--how is really immaterial--but deemed that they might be voting Republican, which virtually all blacks were going to do anyway, you might find when you walked up to a voting booth--I might find if I were walking to the voting booth, someone standing outside brandishing a whip, making it very clear that if I voted for anybody but the Democrat, the whip would be used. So there is sort of a scorched earth policy by citizens, white citizens of the South to reclaim what was theirs, to get blacks off the land, to destroy their property. And the people doing this dirty work are quite often members of these local militias like the Klan. Now the Klan's [coughs], excuse me, the Klans census, its numbers, really hard to peg down at any particular moment, and its popularity ebbs and flows. We're at a moment, it's just come back, it's been destroyed for close to a decade. It's coming back, it will be around for a while, it will fade out for a while, and we'll see in a couple of weeks how it comes back very strongly again. But it is sort of always there at some level as a manifestation of cultural and psychological anxiety.

Now remember during Reconstruction, blacks had a tremendous new amount of voting power. I mean they weren't winning all elected offices, of course, but as they had no representation prior to Reconstruction, any change was a welcome change. When Redemption begins, black voting power is diluted very quickly through a range of tactics. You certainly have people at the polling station with whips. That's a pretty effective way to stop a black person from voting, but you also have gerrymandering, the reconfiguration of voting districts to eliminate or to mitigate the black vote. Since housing segregation was, was the rule of the land, if you cut a district in a certain way, you can make sure that you cut out black voting numbers to make any real change.

So gerrymandering--which is part of, you know, a long tradition. It's not just a Southern one, not just against blacks. Gerrymandering is used. Poll taxes are developed. Essentially you need to come to the poll, the registrar, to prove that you had paid taxes on land that you own according to certain guidelines, you know, generation or whatever. Well, blacks didn't own land, and if it's about their predecessors, their predecessors didn't own land. Or, if they had owned land, or if it's just about maybe just paying, proof of paying taxes, they didn't have the money to pay it. Very effective ways to mitigate the black vote during this era are grandfather clauses. It's very simple: if your grandfather voted, you can vote. Well, basically no blacks' grandfathers had voted. Wipes out the black voting population. And then famously, of course, literacy tests. They're adjudicated by a registrar under the most sort of random--well, they weren't random at all, but subjective--that's what I was looking for--subjective circumstances. So if you could read this section of a state constitution, or if you could recite it from memory, or if you could do anything that suggested you were literate, then you could vote.

Well, although one of the great stories in world history of literacy gain happens during, begins during this era, in terms of blacks becoming a literate population within the course of two generations--hadn't ever happened before--they weren't literate yet as a group. So literacy tests would wipe it out. So you take gerrymandering, you take poll taxes, grandfather clauses, literacy tests, and literal violence, or threat of violence, you're wiping out the black vote. Now it's important to realize, you're also wiping out a lot of the poor white vote. This is an unintended--well, it depends on your interpretation--unintended or intended consequence of those who held the reins of power in the white South.

Professor Holloway: What was certainly unintended--bless you--is that poor whites, and there were a lot of them, and blacks, who were almost, almost by default poor during this era--we're talking into the 18--going into the 1880s--start realizing they actually had a lot in common. They were all hungry. They were all essentially landless. And that the white poor farmer, the poor white farmer had more in common with the poor black farmer than did the white poor farmer did with the white gentry, the political elite. And you have, going into the turn of the century, into the 20th century, the rise of one of the many different articulations of the Populist Party, rise of populism.

Now the history of populism is much more complicated than the one minute I'm going to give it right now. But you have, during the end of the 19th century, a range of different attempts to try to gather some power for poor agrarian classes. And in some places in the South, a curious thing starts happening, that white and black farmers start aligning themselves with each other, start running campaigns--joint tickets, start fighting for the same candidate. Tom Watson, a famous politician from Georgia, actually rises to power, rises to a level of influence, on this notion of, you know, working for agrarian interests. But a funny thing happens, is that it becomes--it starts becoming successful, and there's a realization by the political elite: "My god, if these poor whites and poor blacks start really working together, we're in trouble."  Cause the system is not just about racial domination, but it's also about economic domination.

As a result of the rise in popularity of Populist sentiment, the race card gets played with increasing ferocity. Rhetoric, like you saw in the 1868 campaign poster from a couple of lectures ago, that this is a white man's country, becomes much more commonplace. That we may have different incomes, we may have different sort of economic security, but by God, we're all white, and there's prestige and value in it. And when you have a set of rules or--not rules--a set of social order being bestowed upon the South by the Klan, that's preying upon racial anxiety, as well as going against Catholics and Jews, but preying on racial anxiety, you start seeing fissures in the Populist sentiment just as quickly as they appeared. And Tom Watson being someone who sort of gathered up the energy of a cross racial alliance quickly becomes a hardcore racist and anti-Semite, so this is a radical shift for him. But there's this potential unifying moment, based on class lines, evaporates in the face of racial demagoguery.

That's what this era's about more than anything else. All these other factors certainly are around that helps define who America is, you know, class differences, differences about possibilities related to your gender. But race is the driving factor for so many issues relating to quality of life and safety. Now getting back to the vote, for example, blacks were voting in new and startling numbers during Reconstruction. Blacks were holding office from the local to the federal level, but because of a series of different mechanisms I talked about, because the rise of playing to racial anxieties becomes much more effective, the black vote's wiped out. So just a couple of statistics, just to keep, you know, as representative.

In 1896, we're talking in, in Louisiana, just as one example, over one hundred and thirty thousand blacks are registered to vote in Louisiana, and they are the majority in twenty-six parishes. Black voting representation. Four years later, in just four years, going from over one hundred and thirty thousand blacks, four years later, there are fifty-three hundred blacks on the polls--on the voting rolls, and there are no majority black parishes anywhere. That is an elimination of a voting class, overnight. In one election cycle, or maybe two if it's a two-year election cycle, you go from a possibility of black representation to zero possibility.

In Alabama, of one hundred and eighty thousand black men of voting age in 1900, in the wake of all these different kinds of ways of eliminating the black vote, in 1900, of over one hundred and eighty thousand possible black men who'd be eligible voters, only three thousand are registered to vote. Now if you know anything about Alabama, you'll know there is a large black population in Alabama. There's real opportunities to have black voting representation if people actually had access to the ballot box. There's no access. Three thousand people--three thousand men are registered to vote. Registering to vote, you need to understand, is not a matter of filling out a card and just disinterestedly putting it in the mailbox, something like that. No, registering to vote, if you're a black man, is a matter of life or death, in certain--in many of these places. The possibility of having your home burned down, of getting whipped, getting beaten, and, as we'll see, getting shot, is very real.

Now when it comes to the vote, you have all these forces trying to wipe it out, but it's important to take a moment to try to understand the psychology about why it's so important to wipe it out. We can take a--an example from a famous politician, J. K. Vardaman of Mississippi. Rabid racist. And his view of blacks' ability and education related to their--how civilized they were--and there's that word. I'll start unpacking it later on in the lecture. That they did not have--they were, they were uncivilized, uncivilized, they were not educated enough, they didn't have the ability to be responsible voters. And Vardaman says, another one of these rather lovely sentiments,

"I am just as opposed to Booker Washington as a voter, with all his Anglo-Saxon reinforcements, as I am to the coconut-headed, chocolate-colored typical little coon who blacks my shoes every morning. Neither is fit to perform the supreme function of citizenship."

Booker T. Washington, who we'll be talking about next week. By the late 19th century, the leader of the race; there's no disputing that fact. Even he, the most powerful black person in the country, according to Vardaman, does not possess the ability to be a responsible voter.
Chapter 4. Lynching: The Ultimate Form of Racial Harassment [00:22:07]

Now when all this kinds of--these kinds of harassments fail, if they weren't successful, if they, if they--if Vardaman could whip up enough sentiment among the registrars to, like, just find ways to eliminate the black vote. If you had somebody who could pass the literacy test, who somehow could pass, you know, pay a poll tax, who could pass the bar as established by the registrar to prevent him from voting, there was always the ultimate form of what one could only politely call racial harassment, and that's lynching.

The statistics on lynching are sketchy at best. Historians generally point to the early 1880s as the first moment when reliable records of lynchings first appear. Now it's important to recognize the timing. I made a comment in a previous lecture about the value of a black body. Lynching is not a phenomenon you see during an era, during--prior to the Civil War. Yeah, there's always a sample here and there, but as a phenomenon, it's not there when it comes to slaves, because if you lynched a slave, you lynched somebody's property. You destroyed--You owed them a lot of money. In its own grotesque way, slavery afforded a level of protection for blacks. It certainly wasn't there after emancipation. Of course, that is not a defense of slavery, but that is just sort of an economic element to consider in this equation.

During the period of Federal occupation of the South, there was enough military presence to mitigate these--this form of violence. But when the North is gone, when the Federal troops are gone, during the era of Redemption, this is how--one of the ways the South redeems itself. So reliable records about lynching really point to the early 1880s. There were certain lynchings before then, but consistently, we have records pointing to the 1880s. So between 1882 and 1901, you have recorded more than a hundred lynchings a year throughout the nation. Between 1882 and 1968, when, quote "traditional" forms of lynching essentially disappeared--although they are not gone from us, don't kid yourself about that--over four thou--excuse me over five thousand people died in recorded lynchings. Easily three quarters of them or more were African American. Lynching was not only--Blacks were not the only victims of lynchings. Overwhelmingly, they were the victims of lynchings. But the most important thing to know about these numbers is that these represent recorded lynchings. Historians presume quite safely that numbers were much higher.

Now lynchings were not just about stringing somebody up. There were many different types of lynchings, and this is why it's easy for us to presume that there are, you know, ones that are very public and recorded, and those that just happened very quietly. No one really knows about it. So you have the most obvious, straightforward form of this kind of violence. Someone is captured, they're strung up, and either a chair kicked out from underneath of them, a horse run off, whatever. They die by strangulation, by hanging. But you also have lynchings, it wasn't the majority of them, but they were certainly important to understand the phenomenon of lynching, festival lynches--lynchings. You would have lynchings that are advertised in the local paper, in advance, you know that on Saturday night, we're lynching Joe Smith in Naches. Enough time for rail companies to sell excursion tickets, advertised in the papers, so you could have a grotesque festival around this--this actual moment of murder.

Lynchings may not have just been--weren't just getting strung up, but it could be, involve being nailed to a post or a tree and being lit on fire. It might involve being physically--in fact, often involved being physically assaulted and mutilated while you're conscious, before you're strung up to a post to be burned, or before you're actually strung up by a tree. When the lynching was over, especially for the festival lynchings, the abuse to the body wouldn't end. The body might be chopped down.

As you remember from, in my second lecture, the young Irish butcher dragging a black victim through the streets of New York by his genitals, as a way of sort of declaring his citizenship, I was arguing. Well, body parts were chopped off after lynchings: fingers, toes, genitals, ears are cut off. They are kept as souvenirs, and they are sold as souvenirs. Have a festival lynching in Naches and you might find, three or four days later, in a storefront window, somebody's knee. W. E. B. Dubois, who we'll be talking about next week, has this exact experience, of walking by a window and discovering he's looking at a body part, and realizing that a lynching he'd heard about a week earlier, that was part of that person's body.

Now I mentioned before, over five thousand people lynched. The great majority of whom were black. But who were the victims?--aside from being black men and white men, also some women, but very few in number, but also some women. Overwhelmingly, the narrative says, these were black men accused of rape.

Bless you. That was a very cute sneeze by the way.

Professor Holloway: We have black men accused of rape. That's the received narrative, that's the received wisdom, and so the presumption is that there was some justice being exercised here; that this black man raped this white woman, whoever that might be, and therefore deserves to be murdered. He has violated the sanctity of the South. Much of the language of lynching during this era was on such terms; that it was a manly act to protect white womanhood by avenging the rape; that black brutes who were rapists were demonstrating how uncivilized they were. And so again, lynch mobs were being civilized. They're protecting the bastions of being civilized, of civilized behavior, and protecting their women. Manliness and civilization.

People though, as it turns out, were lynched for a variety of reasons, not just for the accusation of rape. You can sense--you can hear some of these reasons--you can also hear rape, by the way--with a quote from a woman--woman's rights activist, a very prominent one, named Rebecca Latimer Felton. Once a slave owner--in a family of slave owners. And actually, in a strange way, as such an advocate for women's rights, she's actually also advocating for protection of black women, which was unusual. But she was quite convinced that black men were rapists, and they deserved their punishment. Rebecca Felton says here,

"When there is not enough religion in the pulpit to organize a crusade against sin; nor in justice in the court house--nor justice in the court house to promptly punish crime; nor manhood enough in the nation to put a sheltering arm about innocence and virtue, it is lynching [I dropped a word in my own quote here. I'm sorry] it is lynching to protect woman¡¯s dearest possession from the ravening human beasts--if it is lynching [excuse me] to protect woman's dearest possession from the ravening human beasts, then I say lynch. Lynch a thousand times a week if necessary."

Felton is talking about moral order: if there's not enough religion in the pulpit to organize a crusade against sin. Talking about legal justice: if we can't have our criminals be brought to court and tried. And she's talking about manhood again: if we cannot as a nation protect our women, and if lynching is the way to do it, then by God, lynch a thousand times a week.

Now I said that lynching is the--seen as the, the answer for rapists, especially for black male rapists, and that is the received wisdom. But really, what was it?  Ida B. Wells, black woman journalist, becomes an incredible civil rights pioneer, one of the founders of the NAACP, not yet organized. Ida B. Wells lives in Memphis, Tennessee, and of course she hears about the scourge of the black male attacking white womanhood and raping women and children. And then she has a horrific experience. One of her friends, a guy named Thomas Moses--Moss, opens up a store, "The People's Grocery."  He's a black man. And he creates economic competition for a store owned by whites very close by. And that white owned store was the store that catered to that whole area, white and black customers. And Thomas Moss said, "This is an opportunity. I want to open a store as well." And the owners of the other store threatened him. "Do not do this. If you do this, you will pay."  And Moss says, "I'm just opening, you know, opening a store."  Well, he paid with his life. He was lynched for opening up the store. He did not lynch anybody. He did not steal from anybody. I guess he stole potential customers, I suppose, but he was lynched.

Wells writes editorials, organizes a boycott, and then in short order had to flee Memphis to save her life, because she was trying to pull back the cover of this lie about the connection between rape and lynching. She would not return to Memphis for fear of her life until the very end of her life. Decades go by. She's convinced she will be killed if she steps foot back in the city. At that moment when her friend was murdered for opening a store, Ida B. Wells sets out to demonstrate that lynching, claimed as being a way to keep uncivilized blacks down, was actually the perfect manifestation of uncivilized white male behavior, and she starts saying this publicly. She starts writing consistently in ways where she's deemed--she's deemed a threat to Southern manhood. And because she also claimed that white women often desired the interracial dalliances where they--where they actually did exist, she had crossed the final line of taboo, that white women might actually desire black men.

She asked, "If the South is so against rape, why aren't white men lynched?" There's a long history of certainly white slave owners raping their slaves, having children. And certainly after Emancipation, you know, rape knew no color line really. "So why aren't white men being lynched?" she wonders. And then she goes off to England on a speaking tour, again on this anti-lynching crusade. And this is where she really becomes a persona non grata in the South. Southern U.S. at the time had a very strong connection to the notions of British civilizationist hierarchies; that the British were the height of civilized society in the world at that point in time, and the South, with their aristocratic traditions, wanted to be very much like the English model in that way.

Ida B. Wells goes over and starts talking about lynching, starts investigating. She goes on these investigations and reports the investigations. And it turns out, as you'll see in the reading for next week, the accusation of rape isn't even there in most of the lynchings. So there's the popular idea that rape leads to lynching, but that's not even the case in the majority of the situations. Theft, rude behavior, assault, certainly, all of these things lead to people being lynched. And Ida B. Wells tells this to her audiences, women's audiences and men's audiences in England, starts talking about the way that Southern white men actually epitomize uncivilized behavior. And you have society in England start sending investigatory groups over to the South, profoundly humiliating to Southern--Southern cities and towns where these groups might appear. The South is enraged at Ida B. Wells and her inappropriate behavior.

Now this is an era--and I'll speak a little bit more about this next week--an era where the notion of who is the most civilized is really quite important. It may sound kind of strange today, but this was one of the important organizing themes of cultures and societies: having good manners, acting in proper ways. These become dividing lines between who can have access to economic opportunities and who can't. Who's civilized?  Who's manly?  For many Southerners, it seemed like it wasn't even a question, it's beyond debate. Ida B. Wells says, "Not so fast."  Now we'll work though a little bit more this notion of civilization and manliness, well in section I hope, but certainly in next week's reading. But with all this talk about lynching and anti-lynching crusades, it was--there's really an important piece of the puzzle that's missing. Because the conversations about this can actually seem a little bit antiseptic. Lynching was, and remains, a horribly violent and grotesque act.
Chapter 5. Images of Lynching [00:40:04]

Ten years ago--in fact, gosh, exactly ten years ago--small gallery in New York City, the Roth Horowitz Gallery, assembles an exhibit called "Witness: Photographs of Lynchings from the Collection of James Allen," a white man who collected photographs and postcards of lynching scenes.

This is a curious phenomenon, by the way. I mean, I use "curious" in a fully complicated way. At these festival lynchings especially, you would have photographers present who would take pictures, not for the historical record, but to sell next to the kneecaps and genitals in the storefront window. Studio photography of lynchings. Lynchings would appear--Lynching scenes would appear on postcards and would go through the mail till the postmaster general prohibited it in the 1920s, I believe. Anyway, the Collection of James Allen gathered up a fair amount of these photographs and postcards, and the owners of the Roth Horowitz Gallery's would put it together. They're very nervous about it, but they wanted to do it, not from the standpoint of spectacle, which is what their concern was. They didn't want to spectacularize this violence all over again, but to talk for the historical record. These are-these are horrific images, and the fact that they were carried in the mail openly, the fact that they were sold in the windows, is an important part of our national story that we need to know.

Very controversial exhibit, very small gallery. They moved it soon to the New York State--the New York, excuse me, the New York Historical Society in Manhattan, where there were lines around the block, who were very conflicted about this exhibit, but they still went in. Some people said, "You can't, you can't show these things because they're so horrific."  Others said, "That's exactly why you have to show them."  Black and white on both sides of that debate, by the way. I want to share with you some of these images. I do not do it to spectacularize these very awful, awful images, but to help you all to bear witness in a way to the violence, and atrocities, and inhumanity--in a clinical sense, the denial of due process for black victims in the era of Southern Redemption.

Now the images you're going to see cover, chronologically, a broader period of time. We're not just talking the 1860s, 1870s, '80s here, '90s. But, I think you will understand what's going on. Now I'm going to show this, this slideshow. It runs on its own, and at the end of the slideshow, the screen goes black, class is dismissed.

[Slide show starts]

And I'll have side comments to where the handwriting might be a little bit illegible. There were before and after images.

[New Slide] Same man you just saw, his head impaled, his burned head, impaled on the stake. The handwriting would be put there by the photographer, so it could be identified when he sold it in the store.

[New Slide] Litchfield, Kentucky. September Twenty-Six, 1913, and what would appear to be sort of a town center.

[New Slide] Studio shots. And you would have individuals, as you'll see, in the background. You can see them [gestures up] directly above my hand.

[New Slide] This is actually a series of images you're going to see here. And you'll see the physical assault on the body prior to the actual terminal event.

[New Slide] Body's been whipped. He's been whipped. His back has been gouged and speared. And one very curious thing about the studio photography is that

[New Slide] they would cover up the victim's genitals, despite showing all of this, to be proper.

[New Slide] This is the same studio from another image. Several images--several slides ago. She was lynched next to her son.

[New Slide] It's the back of a postcard. "The answer of the Anglo-Saxon race to black brutes who would attack the womanhood of the South."  Here's the answer.

Lecture 5 - Uplift, Accommodation, and Assimilation [January 25, 2010]
Chapter 1. Alexander Crummell [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Let me begin the lecture with the keywords for the lecture. Just a couple of words that will help you understand important themes for this lecture and for Wednesday, for the entire week, really. And those phrases are, the keywords are the Talented Tenth, Talented Tenth, uplift and respectability, putting them together, uplift and respectability, and race management. Talented Tenth, uplift and respectability, and race management. Let me start with a quote.

"It seems manifest to me that as a race in this land, we have no art; we have no science; we have no philosophy; we have no scholarship. Individuals we have in each of these lines, but mere individuality cannot be recognized as the aggregation of a family, a nation, or a race, or as the interpretation of any of them. And until we attain the role of civilization, we cannot stand up and hold our place in the world of culture and enlightenment. And the forfeiture of such a place means inferiority, repulsion, drudgery, poverty, and ultimate death."

The quote is from a man named Alexander Crummell, from one of his final publications--essays--called "Civilization: The Primal Need of a Race," excuse me, "Civilization: The Primal Need of the Race."  You'll see in this lecture, and perhaps even identified a tiny bit in this quote, some linkages to the last lecture, thinking about manliness and civilization, and Ida B. Wells Barnett, and the kinds of claims she was making about the white South, that they were lacking in both. Today we're talking--the reason there's a linkage there, we're talking about the same era, generally speaking. This week, we're going to move from essentially the 1880s into the first decade of the 1900s, just to give you a chronological bearing. And that overlaps a lot with the lecture I was, I had on Wednesday, dealing with Ida B. Wells' anti-lynching crusades as well.

Now I started the lecture with Alexander Crummell, and let me explain why. I think he's a nice vehicle through which we can understand a lot of the themes of this week's lectures. Crummell was a black man, born into a free family in 1819. His family was essentially a minority within a minority. Both parents were literate, they were active abolitionists, and they enjoyed a materially comfortable life in that particular context. Crummell is born free to literate parents and active abolitionists. He's not the typical--This is not the typical African American experience part of emancipation. He's educated by his father and at private schools throughout the Northeast, although not without controversy. In one of the schools he came to in New York, when the townspeople learned that they were going to educate free blacks at that school, really just a one room house, they hitched oxen to the house and pulled it in to a swamp.

Anyway, Crummell does get an education, becomes a minister, and then heads off to Cambridge University in 1848, excuse me, 1845. Crummell's departure for England and his subsequent classical training marked a watershed moment in his personal intellectual development. He originally left the U.S. only to obtain a degree from Cambridge and raise money to build a new church back in the United States. Now he leaves in 1845. He does not come back to the U.S., except for two very brief visits, he does not come back to the U.S. until 1872. So he is gone from the country during the great sectional crisis. Goes to England in 1845, he doesn't stay in England the whole time. He starts getting sick in England, and then he decides to move to a warmer climate for his health. This is the thinking of the time.

He departs for Liberia, the West Coast of Africa, in 1853, and he would remain there for almost two decades. By this action, it appears as if Crummell was doing exactly that which he fought so strongly against in his public orations prior to this moment. He was immigrating to Africa, just as the African Colonization Society recommended African Americans do. This is a group I mentioned in passing a week and a half ago, it's a, you know, a group advocating blacks get out of the United States, and advocating colonization, go back to where they belong is the thinking, in shorthand. Well, when Crummell goes to England, he goes there somewhat against the activity of the African Colonization Society. He's campaigning actively against that idea. We should not send blacks, you know, quote, "back to Africa," black Americans, that is. Their homeland is the United States. But by the time Crummell leaves for Liberia, he actually is advocating colonization. So Crummell goes through this interesting shift, it seems. He leaves for England for a advanced degrees, and to get the education and raise funds to build a church back in the United States. He stays in England, then leaves for Africa, advocating colonization, the very thing that he had been fighting against for his adult life up to that point.

Now Crummell's advocacy for colonization is different from that of people like in the African Colonization Society who are saying, "Let's just get this problem out of our hair."  Crummell believed in the hierarchy of civilization. That's an important phrase, the hierarchy of civilization. And he believed that African natives, who in Crummell's mind were pagan, that African natives were at the bottom of this hierarchy. So instead of advocating for blacks to move to--black Americans to move to Africa to solve an American problem, he's calling for black Americans to move to Africa to solve an African   problem and a Christian problem. Crummell believed that at one time, black Africans were at the top of the civilizational ladder, top of the hierarchy. But over time, with technical innovation and divine providence, very important, he believed that Europeans, especially the English, were now at the top of the hierarchy, top of this ladder. So Crummell's advocating blacks come--black Americans come to Africa to save the Africans, to Christianize them, to rise them up, to lift them up beyond their pagan roots.

Eventually, Crummell becomes frustrated in Liberia with his attempts to civilize the natives through letters in educational salvation. Returns to the United States to head up one of the most prominent churches in Washington D.C., St. Luke's Episcopal, serving a predominantly black and almost exclusively wealthy black community. Comes back in 1872, starts up this--heads up this church and really helps expand it and grow it, and he dies in 1898. Now what does all this have to do with today's lecture? 

Crummell embodies many of the important elements that define black leadership and elite life in the second half of the 19th century. Although he did not coin the phrase, Crummell lived the ideology that suggested the Talented Tenth. The Talented Tenth would be the ones to save the race. Although he did not live long enough to see it mature, Crummell founded the American Negro Academy. More about that in a few minutes. Crummell founded the American Negro Academy which took as its--as its explicit mission to save the race via the profound ideas of the Talented Tenth. And although Crummell sees himself certainly as at least a political progressive, if not a radical, one can see in this quick glimpse, this tour of his biography, a notion that blacks had not attained sufficient greatness to be considered contributors to the civilized world. You can see in this kind of ideology--this kind of sentiment an inherent conservatism. And in this way, Crummell's a race manager. So much of his project is about trying to find a way to save the race, to manage its problems and its solutions.


Chapter 2. The Talented Tenth [00:09:44]

Again, the keywords for today are Talented Tenth, uplift and respectability, and, implicit in both, race management. As I stated a few minutes ago, this lecture--this week's worth of lectures lingers between around 1890 and 1910, an era famously referred to, at least famously in the black community, as the nadir, the worst part, the N-A-D-I-R, the nadir, the worst part of the free black experience. Saw last week frightful representations of white control via lynching, and I talked about other methods of social and political control used by whites to eliminate black economic opportunity and the black male voting presence. Now as bad as these things were, there's no doubt it was horrific, it would be a mistake to say that blacks were without hope, that they were an utterly downtrodden people, doomed to their degraded position. There were in fact glimmers of hope and activism, even though it grew out of a reality of despair. So a profoundly difficult time for the post-emancipation African American experience, but don't bottle it up and say it's all despair and all misery.

See glimmers of hope can be identified in, sort of in essentially two ways: on the ground in daily acts of resistance, like the kinds you had read about in Tera Hunter's wonderful book To 'Joy My Freedom. And you see glimmers of hope perhaps in polite society, via the work of reformers, churches, societies, and associations. A few quick words about on the ground resistance. We know from Tera Hunter that thinking about struggle--her book, her argument, is about struggle on the ground, and the ways in which the black community was negotiating class politics during this era--on the ground struggles of daily resistance means small acts of resistance, until people like Tera Hunter came along, lost to history, one would think. It's about doing work more slowly than you possibly can. It means stealing scraps when you know you shouldn¡¯t be, stealing labor in a sense in the houses where you work or in the factories where you worked. Quietly finding ways to say no to the orders that you've been given, to the life you've been forced to lead, although outwardly you're saying yes.

You can't discount these small acts of daily resistance. They are important. Think of Tera Hunter's laundry workers who would claim control of their bodies in the evening when they went out dancing. They had some sort of real psychological relief, physical relief, in exerting control over their own bodies and being out in a certain space, even though their own--their bosses wouldn't have appreciated it, and certainly the black elite looked down their noses at their actions. This is important, but it's also important to realize the psychological benefits could be fleeting, in the acts of daily resistance, because the fact of the matter is, when those workers woke up the next morning after a great night out, they had to go back to work. They had to find a way to put food on the table. And so although we cannot discount the benefits of psychological relief, we need to understand them as well for the real limits that they had. Life remained difficult.

Now you have, at the same time as Tera Hunter's washerwomen, black activists who were thinking of long term gains for the black community that extended beyond the boundaries of their own body. These were the people, it's important to realize, who had the freedom and security to think beyond the daily existence. They had some means. Now we're not talking wealthy people, rich people, but they had some sort of security. They knew there were meals coming all week long. Their--Their house, they owned their house, they had shelter. They had some measure of education. So they had the leisure time to think about long-term solutions. These were the people who considered themselves the Talented Tenth. These were the people who thrived in polite society and who saw it as their duty to uplift the race.


Chapter 3. The Uplift Ideology [00:15:09]

Bless you. This last phrase, I want you to think about and what's important for this lecture. They saw it as their duty to uplift the race. Now for the rest of the lecture I'm going to, in a sense, explore that phrase, and extrapolate meaning from it. For the rest of the lecture, I want to explore uplift's roots in the Northern church. I'll explore the linkage between uplift and the new growth of associations in American culture. But most importantly, I want to explore uplift's investment in gender dynamics and uplift's equally subversive and conservative nature. It's really critical that you understand uplift was, at its core, a dynamic ideology that was imbued with that era's restrictive gender and class conventions. There's a gendered element to uplift, there's a class element to uplift, that make uplift both subversive--subversive and conservative. Think back to my framing of Alexander Crummell's life. He considered himself a political progressive and yet his ideology was fundamentally conservative.

Let's look at uplift's roots. We can trace uplift back as an identifiable ideology to a group called the American Baptist Home Mission Society, the American Baptist Home Mission Society. It's a Northern and white-run effort to educate and civilize Southern blacks. It's the Post-Emancipation and Reconstruction era we're talking about here. The American Baptist Home Mission Society is a Northern, white-run effort to educate and civilize Southern blacks. One of the leaders of the Home Mission Society is a man named Henry Morehouse. He's the man, white man, who coined the phrase Talented Tenth, that that ten percent of black America, really much more like a tenth of one percent, would be that group to uplift the race, to lift it up. In fact, Henry Morehouse, for those who know your historically black colleges--colleges and universities, Morehouse College, the most important black college for educating black men in history--still is, still is there today, still doing amazing work--is named for Henry Morehouse.

Anyway, this is an era when church membership--so why the American Baptist Home Mission Society?  This is an era when church membership is increasing rapidly, but organized religious bodies start to clash with what can best be called grassroots black worship styles from religious organizations. One of the things that's important to recognize is that much as prior to emancipation, blacks couldn¡¯t marry, they couldn¡¯t get an education, very often they couldn't practice their own religious faiths, certainly not openly and publicly. So you see a sort of boom in black America, a public exhortation, or demonstration, of the desire to practice faith. But they wanted to do it in their own ways and form their own religious organizations. This is a complicating factor, to put it mildly, when it came to the American Baptist Home Mission Society. The Home Mission Society was coming down from the North, setting up schools and churches, setting up schools in sort of the same spirit as the Freedmen's Bureau, setting up churches, Baptist churches, setting up an order of prayer, systems of practice, to educate and civilize--civilize through faith, adherence to the Bible and Christian ethics--so to save the, save the race.

Well, blacks begin to bristle at the fact that they are not allowed by the American Baptist Home Mission Society structure, that they aren't allowed to contribute to the Sunday school teaching literature. Whatever they had to teach on a Sunday was, quote, "given to them" by this Northern church. The American Baptist Publication Society refused their contributions. It's a tension here about religion and religious teaching, practices certainly, but it's also about control over their secular activities. The American Baptist Home Mission Society wanted blacks to function in accordance with their guidelines and their principles. And, increasingly, blacks were saying, "I'm, you know, I'm getting frustrated by this."  You have a breaking point in 1895, the year, as you'll see over this lecture and next lecture, very important year. Serious breach appears in 1895 when a number of blacks come together, Southern blacks, too frustrated any longer to abide by the American Baptist Home Mission Society's edicts, and forms its own society, the National Baptist Convention.

The National Baptist Convention is created by and about blacks. It's organized to establish black control over the church, their churches, their religious practices and secular activities. It even goes as far as to establish its own publishing company so it could produce, among other things, Sunday school literature written by blacks. So you have the American Baptist Home Mission Society coming down from the North with a frankly patronizing attitude about saving the race. After some time, the race says, "We'll form our own organization if you won't let us have some control in our own churches."  Thus the National Baptist Convention is formed.

Now before going any further, going any further, it's important to think about what a church actually was. These were places to worship, of course, but it's also important to realize that churches play many different roles in the black community, and the white community as well, but we're talking about the African American experience right here. These churches were places where they taught literacy. Certainly that's what Sunday school classes are partly about as well, but we're talking sort of daily education. They were also places to find food. If you're running short on food, you go to the church to be fed or get some supplies--provide basic healthcare, employment information, clothes. So the church was not just a place functioning in the black community--community as a site on Sundays to be in deep reflection and other days to seek solace. It was doing that certainly, but also feeding, educating, clothing the black community, and providing basic healthcare as well. So the church needs to be understood as what one scholar calls "a discursive space in the black public sphere whose very conscious role was to uplift the race."  "A discursive space in the black public sphere whose very conscious role was to uplift the race."  Saving the race through God, through food, through education, through clothing, through healthcare, across the board. So churches were religious and secular spaces.

Now in addition to the growing secular activity of the black church, there's a rapid expansion of intellectual, social, and literary societies in black America. Now this is a phenomenon across the races, the United States during this time, the late 19th century. It's important to realize the significant organizations in black America weren't--black America weren't just the churches. There's cultural and intellectual societies as well. As far as black America was concerned, these societies, these associations, were all a part of the struggle to become self sufficient. It's important to protect its own flanks and to provide for those who are less fortunate.

So you have fraternal orders and benefit societies, like the Masons, the Odd Fellows, the Knights of Tabor, all of which were for men. Or the Order of the Eastern Star, the Sisters of the Colanth for women. You have secret societies offering insurance--insurance against sickness and death, and aid to widows and orphans. And then eventually, you have insurance societies, companies, most famously the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company. This is the largest black business in the United States for quite some time. The rise of black banks and so on. So you see a range of really, for lack of a better phrase, community service associations developing. Places for fellowship, sort of a secular fellowship, certainly, but also a place to gather to sort out information about somebody who might be in trouble that we can help out, to sort of raise funds to improve schools by hiring a new teacher perhaps; to provide resources when somebody dies, a mutual aid benefit society; give resources to the children, widows; to literally put your money some place. These were all rather dramatic changes. They may not--may not seem like much, but again, when you're starting from zero, anything is something.

So in addition to these service societies, you have intellectual societies, like the American Negro Academy, founded in 1897. The ANA, the American Negro Academy, was not the first of its sort, but it was the first to talk about uplift in systematically intellectual ways. So it's not about job training. It's not about finding clothes or food for somebody. It's about saving the race through the power of the intellect and through training. The ANA was limited to twenty or so leading men of the race, this would be the phrase of the time. Women were not allowed. And the goal of the ANA, those twenty leading men, would be to develop the next generation of leaders to solve America's racial ills. It's a rather ambitious goal, but that was it, quite literally.

W. E. B. Du Bois, someone who--a lot of you may see "Du-bwah" when you see the name, it's "Du-boys,"  that's the way his family pronounced it--W. E. B. Du Bois, who we'll hear more about tomorrow, and we'll hear about intermittently throughout the course, a man of incredible importance in the 20th century African American experience--Du Bois had just received his PhD from Harvard, and is the first vice president of the organization. He's Alexander Crummell's prot¨¦g¨¦. As I said before, the ANA was exclusive to men. It's an organization that really lasts about twenty-five years before it falls apart. I can't say that it changes much of anything. It establishes a journal, it publishes ideas, it has lectures. Early on, it allowed one woman to lecture before its august body. But that was sort of, I mean I'm simplifying it, but the ANA did not offer much in transactional change for black America, but it's articulating a vision that the way to save the race was through developing the intellect, civilizing the race with its most educated men.

Right at the same time the American Negro Academy is formed, in fact a year earlier, another association is formed, certainly more important and effective, called the National Association of Colored Women. The National Association of Colored Women, NACW. Tellingly, the motto of the NACW is "Lifting while we climb."  "Lifting while we climb." Now what did it do?  It was sort of an amalgamation of the American Negro Academy ethos, and the American Baptist Home Mission Society, and National Baptist Convention. It's an organization of middle and upper classes, as far as status--social status--middle and upper class black women, the "best sort" as it were. That they would gather together on a, I don't know, twice a month, monthly basis, network socially certainly. But they would also organize political protests, something really quite astonishing. This is not the kind of person, not the kind of woman, not the kind of class figure who would publicly protest. But I didn't think to bring the image with me, but in the very first lecture, I showed a slide of members of the NACW picketing the White House for an anti-lynching law in the 1930s. Here's a woman who'd walk the picket line to press a political point. And they also conducted basic agitation for child welfare reform.

So they're trying to network amongst themselves, raise the political stakes, and also agitate for child welfare reform. They're like the ANA, because they're a certain type of person, of class. They're like the Baptist Home Mission Society in the sense that they were trying to uplift the race, save the children. And in a sense like the National Baptist Convention, by acting in explicitly political ways. And the National Baptist Convention's own creation was an explicitly political act. Thinking from the NACW's perspective, uplift can be seen as both subversive and conservative. It was subversive, since it was helping educate and clean up poor and unclean people. Sad, sad to say, but this was a subversive act, trying to clean people up, trying to improve their health. And this is really something you need to be aware of. This was an era of an epidemiologist's nightmare. Cities are really forming rapidly. People are coming to urban centers, but hygiene isn't coming as fast as the people are coming. Cities and streets literally built on top of filth, of refuse, excrement. Disease is in the air. Tera Hunter lays this out in her book, all these campaigns to teach proper hygiene habits. It wasn't just about nice manners--nice manners and a white dress. These were life and death kind of skills they were trying to teach the poor and the unclean. Trying to wage anti-tuberculosis campaigns, for instance.

So the NACW is trying to do something radical by trying to help educate and clean up people who were ignored by society. But it was also--excuse me, and it was also subversive for the way it engaged in explicit acts of political resistance like picketing, advocating anti-lynching, the passing of anti-lynching law, lobbying people. But uplift from NACW's perspective, or it's--the way it interpreted uplift, was also quite conservative, because NACW membership recognized in itself the express need for them to clean up the race; that the duty--I used the phrase, the word earlier in the lecture--it was the duty of the black middle and upper class, especially the women, to save the race, to clean it up and to get the poor and dirty blacks, Southern blacks, to learn how to behave respectably. Think back to the last lecture, the manliness and civilization, respectability floating through all of that. To the women of the NACW, they had a lot of work to do. Most blacks were unclean, and poorly behaved, and uneducated. So uplift taken all together then, radical and conservative, but essentially a manifestation of white middle class propriety that these black Victorians grew up in, took it as their own, and tried to perfect it for the next generation. Black women felt a sense of duty, these black middle class women and upper class women felt a sense of duty, and they had a special ability from their self-conception. They had a special ability to save the race.

Anna Julia Cooper, the leading black feminist theorist of her day, who was also a leading educator having taught at Dunbar High School--actually, I want to talk about Dunbar for just a few seconds, because it's actually a remarkable institution. I'll probably mention it in a few weeks. Anna Julia Cooper taught mathematics at--It was actually the M Street High School at the time in Washington, D.C. It's name is changed eventually to Dunbar. Dunbar becomes the breeding ground, over the first five decades of the 20th century, of the black leadership elite for the D.C. area and, actually, for much of the nation. If you look at a lot of black political leaders, you will often see Dunbar High School on the r¨¦sum¨¦. So, you know, talking about a leading intellectual teaching at a high school, and that, and that, how can that be important?  Dunbar was not your typical high school. It was by far the best black high school in the country. It was the best public high school in the District, black or white. If you look at the kind of training that the teachers had and the eventual career path of its graduates, it's an astonishing institution.

Anyway Anna Julia Cooper, leading theorist of her day, teaches at Dunbar High School. Later on in her career, she leaves Dunbar. I think she's sixty-three when she gets her PhD from the Sorbonne. She comes back to Washington, D.C. and establishes a university, Frelinghuysen University--I probably butchered it, I don't know German. Essentially an evening university, "university" in sort of quotes, an institution where black workers who want to make that next step in advancement will come and get training in the evening, and so they can get a better job. That's all quite a big tangent. Anna Julia Cooper, the leading black feminist theorist of her day and educator, exemplified this uplift ideology espoused by the NACW, and she made all of this quite clear, as early as 1892, even before the NACW was formed.

There's a, There's an interesting history behind NACW, two different black women's organizations trying to fight it out over which would be the one to represent the race, and they merged in the NACW. In 1892, years before the NACW is formed, years before the American Negro Academy is formed, Anna Julia Cooper writes her manifesto, A Voice from the South. It's a long book, very important. We can reduce it, at least today, to one quote. Cooper says, in A Voice from the South,

"Only the black woman can say where and when I enter, in the quiet, undisputed dignity of my womanhood, without violence and without suing or special patronage, then and there the whole Negro race enters with me."

"Only the black woman," I repeat, "Only the black woman can say where and when I enter, in the quiet, undisputed dignity of my womanhood, without violence and without suing or special patronage, then and there the whole Negro race enters with me."

Women, black women, black elite women, black educated women, were the ones, the only ones, who could say how, when, and where blacks would rise up and join society as rightful members. Now Alexander Crummell, a man of his own time, recognized Anna  Julia Cooper's intellect and her, and her unique skills, but he was certainly as conservative on gender lines as one might expect. He certainly would have taken issue, or took issue with the idea that it was women upon whom this burden was placed, to uplift the race. So there's a sort of gendered battle there about who it was most prepared to save the race. But Cooper and Crummell shared the same ideology. It's the educated person, the civilized person, that's who would save the race. Uplift is a middle class ideology then that was as much about race management as it was about anything else. Who was going to manage the race during a period of transition?  Post-Reconstruction, era of Redemption, an era of the destruction of black male voting rights. Cooper declares that since women were perfectively respectable, a certain kind of woman, that they were the ones who would be the best race managers, who could espouse a Talented Tenth ideology and help navigate the race to a better way of living.

Respectability is something that you really need to linger on here, as well, throughout all of this. It's the reflection of a bourgeois vision that vacillates between an attack on the failure of America to live up to its liberal ideals of equality and justice. Think about Ida B. Wells, that the white South lacked a proper notion of respectable behavior, because it was lynching these people. So respectability could vacillate between an attack on the failure of America to live up to its liberal ideals, like Ida B. Wells did, or respectability could be used as an attack on the values of lifestyles of the very blacks who transgressed this white middle class propriety. It cuts both ways. People like Ida B. Wells could tell white America, "Shame on you for being so cowardly when you brandished the whip and threatened with the lynching mob."  Ida B. Wells could also tell black Americans she believed beneath her--this wasn't really Ida B. Wells's style, but I'm taking, extending the point--"Shame on you for acting in ways that are improper." 

Now I opened this lecture with a quote from Alexander Crummell about the need for civilization, sketched out Crummell's life experiences and explained why he's such a great representative figure for the era. Let me close with a quote from his prot¨¦g¨¦, W. E. B. Du Bois. This will be one of the main figures I'll focus on in--on Wednesday's lecture. We can see in this quote the way in which the ideology of the Talented Tenth was driven by commitment to uplift the race and that this commitment to uplift the race was driven by the belief that the black poor, the black unwashed, were a negative drain on all blacks in America. Again, uplift was race management. And by the way, for those of you who know a thing or two about W. E. B. Du Bois and the phrase Talented Tenth, these two are linked, because Du Bois does write about the Talented Tenth, but he's not the person who coins the phrase. He uses it from Morehouse's American Baptist Home Mission Society, just so you're straight on this issue. Anyway, Du Bois says the following:

"Men of America, the problem is plain before you. Here is a race transplanted through the criminal foolishness of your fathers. Whether you like it or not the millions are here, and here they will remain. If you do not lift them up, they will pull you down. Education and work are the levers to uplift a people. Work alone will not do it unless inspired by the right ideals and guided by intelligence. Education must not simply teach work, it must teach Life. The Talented Tenth of the Negro race must be made leaders of thought and missionaries of culture among their people. No others can do this work, and Negro colleges must train them--train men for it. The Negro race, like all other races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men."

Okay, I'll stop there, and we'll begin on Wednesday talking about--we'll focus on Wednesday talking about Du Bois and his great foil, Booker T. Washington, and all of the different competing ideologies that are expressed in this time of incredible change for black America. Thank you.
Lecture 6 - Uplift, Accommodation, and Assimilation (continued) [January 27, 2010]
Chapter 1. The Chronological Context for Today¡¯s Lecture [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  On Monday we talked about uplift and its various ways one can interpret uplift--and I know you had a lot of that information in the Tera Hunter reading, but it's really one of these sort of foundational issues for this class I wanted to sort of labor over for a while. Another foundational issue is one of those keywords talking about, I talked about on Monday, which is race management. Essentially, that's what this lecture today is about. This is a lecture looking at Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois and the politics of accommodation and assimilation. It is a debate that has manifested itself in many different forms, in different voices throughout so much of the post-emancipation African American experience, and it's a debate that's still with us today, in ways that I'm pretty sure will be coming back into play on and off during the rest of this term.

So the historian in me always wants to contextualize. I want you--and I'm not crazy about dates, but I want to give you a timeline. It's important for you to actually put down in your notes. I'm not putting up on the screen cause it would be a one slide show. It wouldn't make any sense, but understand this timeline. Generally speaking, at the post-emancipation moment, 1866 forward, you have the appearance of a range of Jim Crow laws separating the races. I can't tell you a specific start date, because they vary by state. But it's important to know that they start with miscegenation, this fear over black and white sex, black male and white female specifically.

So there are laws against miscegenation, at first. Then there are laws in some states about separating the races as far as education. "Now we're going to actually have to educate these black folks, we can't educate them in the same space."  And then within about a decade, now we're talking mid-1870s, the laws start appearing on separating the races in areas of public accommodation, transportation. And that's really where most people point to the start of most Jim Crow laws, is around the mid-1870s. That's the first point in the timeline, the mid-1870s.

You already know about Reconstruction, the rise of Redemption, of course. 1895 I pointed to in the last lecture as being a rather important year. You have in 1895 the National Baptist Convention formed, as I talked about on Monday. You have in that same year the great leader of the race, Frederick Douglass, dies. A major political figure in black and white America. You have also in 1895 Booker T. Washington, the subject of half of this lecture, giving his famous Atlanta Cotton Exposition Address. So the National Baptist Convention is formed, Frederick Douglass dies, Booker T. Washington rises in prominence, all in the same year.

Eighteen ninety-six, the National Association of Colored Women is formed, a group I canvassed in the latter part of yes--of Monday's lecture. The same year, the Supreme Court offers its decision in Plessy v. Ferguson. More on that in today's lecture. In 1897, the American Negro Academy is formed and in 1898, Alexander Crummell, with whom I began Monday's lecture, dies. So in this three year window, you have the assertion of religious, organizational, and secular independence with the National Baptist Convention, the death of an icon, Frederick Douglass, the rise of another icon in Booker T. Washington, the formation of a women's political organizing association and social organization, a very important Supreme Court decision, the founding of one of these elitist attempts to solve race problems, to uplift the race, and in 1898, the death of one of those icons, representing the leaders in the Talented Tenth. Undergirding all of that are these Jim Crow laws. So that's the context, chronological context for today's lecture.


Chapter 2. Booker T. Washington and the Politics of Accommodation and Assimilation [00:04:39]

Let me begin playing an excerpt. It's scratchy, I know. I'm just going to play about, I think about forty-five seconds of it, but it's also kind of remarkable.



Booker T. Washington: A ship lost at sea for many days suddenly sighted a friendl vessel. From the mast of the unfortunate vessel was seen a signal, ¡°Water, water; we die of thirst!¡± The answer from the friendly vessel at once came back, ¡°Cast down your bucket where you are.¡± A second time the signal, ¡°Water, send us water!¡± ran from the distressed vessel, and was answered, ¡°Cast down your bucket where you are.¡± And a third and fourth signal for water was answered, ¡°Cast down your bucket where you are.¡± The captain of the distressed vessel, at last heeding the injunction, cast down his bucket, and it came up full of fresh, sparkling water from the mouth of the Amazon River. To those of my race who depend on bettering their condition in a foreign land or who underestimate the importance of cultivating friendly relations with the southern white man, who is their next-door neighbor, I would say: ¡°Cast down your bucket where you are¡±¡ª cast it down in making friends in every manly way of the people of all races by whom we are surrounded.

Now that's--that's frankly just show and tell. That's Booker T. Washington, reading from his famous Cotton--Atlanta Cotton Exposition address. I know it's hard to hear, but I'm going to go over it. And it's also in the reading for this week. But it really is--we're entering a new technological age for the whole country, and sound certainly is part of this technological innovation. And we'll be seeing more of this as this course goes along, more sound files and movie clips, certainly. Now again, I know it's in your reading, but it's important that we belabor part of the Cotton Exposition address, because it sets up--it lays down sort of the political foundation for so much of the late nineteenth century political philosophy. The clip you just heard, that's Booker T. Washington saying,

"A ship lost at sea for many days suddenly sighted a friendly vessel. From the mast of the unfortunate vessel was seen a signal, ¡°Water, water; we die of thirst!¡± The answer from the friendly vessel at once came back, ¡°Cast down your bucket where you are.¡± A second time the signal, ¡°Water, water, send us water!¡± ran up from the distressed vessel, and was answered, ¡°Cast down your bucket where you are.¡± And a third and fourth signal for water was answered, ¡°Cast down your bucket where you are.¡± The captain of the distressed vessel, at last heeding the injunction, cast down his bucket, and it came up full of fresh, sparkling water from the mouth of the Amazon River. To those of my race who depend on bettering their condition in a foreign land or who underestimate the importance of cultivating friendly relations with the southern white man, who is their next-door neighbor, I would say: 'Cast down your bucket where you are; cast it down in making friends in every manly way of the people of all races by whom we are surrounded. Cast it down in agriculture, mechanics, in commerce, in domestic service, and in the professions. And in this connection it is well to bear in mind that whatever other sins the South may be called to bear, when it comes to business, pure and simple, it is in the South that the Negro is given a man¡¯s chance in the commercial world, and in nothing is this Exposition--and in nothing is this Exposition is more eloquent than in emphasizing this chance. Our greatest danger is that in the great leap from slavery to freedom we may overlook the fact that the masses of us are to live by the productions of our hands, and fail to keep in mind that we shall prosper in proportion aswe are--as we learn to dignify and glorify common labour, and put brains and skill into the common occupations of life. No race can prosper till it learns that there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem. It is at the bottom of life we must begin, and not at the top. Nor should we permit our grievances to overshadow our opportunities. To those of the white race who look to the incoming of those of foreign birth and strange tongue and habits for the prosperity of the South, were I permitted I would repeat what I say to my own race, 'Cast down your bucket where you are.' Cast it down among the eight millions of Negroes whose habits you know, whose fidelity and love you have tested in days when to have proved treacherous meant the ruins of your firesides. Cast down your bucket among these people who have, without strikes and labor wars, tilled your fields, cleared your forests, builded your railroads and cities, and brought forth treasures from the bowels of the earth, and helped make possible this magnificent representation of the progress of the South. Casting down your bucket among my people, helping and encouraging them as you are doing on these grounds, and to educate--and to education of head, hand, and heart, you will find that they will buy your surplus land, make blossom the waste places of your fields, and run your factories. While doing this, you can be sure in the future, as in the past, that you and your families will be surrounded by the most patient, faithful, law-abiding, and unresentful people that the world has ever seen. As we have proved our loyalty to you in the past, in nursing your children, watching by the sick-bed of your mothers and fathers, and often following them with tear-dimmed eyes to their graves, so in the future, in our humble way, we shall stand by you with a devotion that no foreigner can approach, ready to lay down our lives, if need be, in defense of yours, interlacing our industrial, commercial, civil, and religious life with yours in a way that shall make the interests of both races one. In all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress. The wisest of my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremest folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than of artificial forcing. No race that has anything to contribute to the modern world--to the markets of the world is long in any degree ostracized. It is important and right that all privileges of the law be ours, but it is vastly more important that we be prepared for the exercise of these privileges. The opportunity to earn a dollar in a factory just now is worth infinitely more than the opportunity to spend a dollar in an opera house."

Three excerpts from this critical speech, 1895. The clip I played and the excerpt I began reading revolves around the phrase "cast down your bucket."  It's a compelling story, a ship lost at sea, not realizing it's at the mouth of the Amazon River, thinking it's going to die, and safety was all around it. Washington is telling the members of the Atlanta--Atlanta Cotton Exposition, gathering of business leaders, trying to raise money to save the South, or improve the South in economic terms. Washington's telling them that they need to trust blacks to do the right thing. He's telling the white industrialists, the agricultural leaders, you know, "You're trying to import immigrant labor. Don't do it. There's a not a tradition of labor organizing, union organizing, and strikes among blacks."  That's because they weren't allowed in unions. That's another issue of course. But Washington's telling the white owners of the factories, and the mills, and the fields, "This is a workforce you can trust, who's toiled by you, who's nurtured you and nursed you, and we'll be faithful. We've proved our faithfulness in the past."  So it's a nativist argument. "We don't want foreign labor in here." 

It's also an argument about race management. He begins by telling blacks, "Look, you can't agitate. You need to recognize that this is our home, the South,and  the rural South. This is where we are and this where we need to make our futures. And with patience, and with time, as we prove our fidelity, we'll be able to demonstrate that we are worthy of buying that land, tilling our own fields, becoming economically independent."  As he says himself, "The wisest among our race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremest folly."  It's a take it slow approach. Now--oh one other very important phrase to know from the Atlanta Cotton Exposition address is this sentence:  "That in all things that are purely social, we can be as separate as the fingers; yet one is the hand on all things essential to mutual progress."  Critically important sentence, and you'll start to see why. This is 1895. The next year, the Supreme Court hands down its--hands down its decision in Plessy v. Ferguson. The majority of the court, in an eight to one decision, holds the following:

"We consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction on it."

The majority is saying--claiming that separation of the races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority, is all in the colored race's head. Badge of inferiority. The dissent written by--well he's the only person writing it--Justice John Harlan, says that

"... the arbitrary separation of the citizens on the basis of race, while they're on a public highway, is a badge of servitude, wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality before the law established by the Constitution."

The majority is saying the badge of inferiority is nonexistent. It's a construction. It's in their minds. And Harlan says exactly the opposite. It is a badge of servitude to force the separation of the races in public accommodations. Now what was Plessy?  What was this case about?  Many of you know, I'm sure, the outlines of it. June7th, 1892, Homer Plessy, a U.S. citizen, resident of Louisiana, buys a first class rail ticket. He boards the train and takes a seat in the first class coach. It's a whites only coach. You wouldn't be surprised, I imagine. He's asked to move. Conductor understands that he's not white. And Plessy refuses and is thrown off the train and thrown into jail. He's broken the Jim Crow laws of segregation of the races in Louisiana, the statute established in 1890.

Homer Plessy argued that such segregation violated the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. The Supreme Court said in response, three years later, that racial separation did not abridge the privileges or immunities of U.S. citizens, or deprive persons of liberty or property without the due process of the laws, you know, the tenets of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court says it doesn't do any of these things, separating the races. There's still due process. You still have rights as a citizen.

Now Plessy, it's worth knowing, was convinced he would win this case. He actually pursued the legal crisis in the first place. He didn't just walk up to the ticket booth thinking, "I'm going to buy a first class rail ticket and have a nice quiet ride, you know, to my destination."  He knew the law. He thought it was wrong, and so he decided to test it, and he thought he would win. And Plessy really also thought that he would win it because his own literal embodiment would prove how absurd segregation practices and laws really were. Going by the very clumsy and messy sort of dividing one's up one's blood by races, Plessy was seventh--seven-eighths white, and was so fair skinned, he could easily pass for white. In fact, he had to confirm with the conductors, "Yeah, I'm black."  The law of the land is, if you had just one, quote, "drop of black blood" you were black.

So Plessy ostensibly is a white man, ostensibly, has black heritage, so he is black legally. Would only, you know, only by declaring his race would people realize that he was breaking a law in the first place. He says, "The law is ridiculous, and I'm going to test it, and I'm going to win it." Well, he misjudged the justices. So you have, starting in 1866 but speeding up and going from miscegenation to education to transportation, generally speaking, a range of Jim Crow laws separating the races. When Plessy v. Ferguson is decided, announced in 1895, separate but equal is established as in line with the Constitution, and it will remain the law until Brown v. Board of Education's passed, ah passed?  Declared in 185--1954. So we're talking about almost sixty years of constitutionally supported federal law, and then state laws, established with Plessy v. Ferguson.

Now the Supreme Court offers its decision in 1896, but the case had been in process since 1892. Why does this matter?  I mean we all know these things take a while to bubble up to the Supreme Court. It matters because there's no doubt that when Booker T. Washington rose to speak at the Atlanta--Atlanta Cotton Exposition in 1895, he knew that efforts were underway to challenge racial separation. Washington, however, openly and famously accommodated to white southern and northern business interests. This was not a little quiet case kind of trickling its way up through the system. Washington was a well educated man. He knew about race politics, of course. And so he made a conscious decision in 1895 to declare that he's on the side of southern business interests and northern business interests, separating the races to reduce racial anxiety of these whites. He knew that Plessy v. Ferguson was being fleshed out--fleshed out in the legal system.

So when you take these two moments together, Washington's speech and Plessy, you can see that for many, this embodies sort of the low point that I referenced in Monday's lecture, the low point of the post-emancipation African American experience, certainly in the realm of political rights, equal rights, full citizenship rights. Now it's pretty easy to launch into an extended critique of Washington, especially in light of the context of the era when he's giving this famous speech. But let me give you a bit of biography and put us in his shoes in a bit to see his world view, and see where we end up.

Washington is born in 1856. He's born a slave. He worked as a child, before emancipation and after emancipation. He knew--his life was a life of work. He's out in the coalfields in West Virginia and then finds out about this school, this college, called the Hampton Institute, in the far east coast of Virginia, and he decides this is the place for him. And so he literally works his way there via odd jobs. He has no money, so he's working odd jobs to get some more money to--to find a way to get to the next way station, before he finds himself in Hampton, Virginia, at the Institute. And he's working odd jobs there, while in school. And at the end of the term, at the end of the school year, he worked his way back home, literally working his way back home.

Through his labor and his intellect, he becomes the schools--the prot¨¦g¨¦ of the school's principal. Hampton, it's important to know, was an institute dedicated to vocational education. That was the rationale of the Hampton--Hampton Institute. Learning crafts and skills was critical. This is about how to become a better manager of crops, how to become an expert cabinetmaker. It was about trying to develop technical expertise in agricultural endeavors, for instance. The idea of, you know, high culture, elite refinement, these things could wait.

In 1881, Washington is twenty-one--twenty-five years old, and with the support of his mentor at the Hampton Institute, establishes his own institute, called the Tuskegee Institute. Now Hampton and Tuskegee are still around today. They are very different than they were before--they were at this, this era. We're talking about the founding moments. So Washington establishes the Tuskegee Institute, in Tuskegee, Alabama, and it's really quite remarkable. He's--he's establishing something at the heart of white farming land in Alabama.

And what you see in establishing Tuskegee is Washington's incredible skills at building coalitions, at not appearing threatening to a white elite, or even white small farmers, yeoman farmers. He starts buying up land for this institute. He--he gets his first students, and they start building, literally building, this institute. And eventually, Tuskegee, the institute, becomes the life blood of Tuskegee, the community. It becomes the economic engine of this town. And this is in a way a manifestation of Booker T. Washington's long term strategy. I'm not saying Tuskegee was a racial oasis, or that blacks were fully integrated, but through Washington's model, he economically integrated blacks into Tuskegee, the town. And this is his long term plan.

Eventually, blacks will get their full rights, but they do it through long, slow, hard work, through labor, and becomes--by becoming so economically vital to wherever they are, one could not help but strive to incorporate them in society. This very go-slow approach, Washington's great skills at interacting with and negotiating with white business leaders, results in he becomes the darling of the philanthropists and starts getting money thrown at him, by especially northern business interests, allowing him to build up Tuskegee further, and allowing him over the course of the next twenty or so years, to build up--especially after 1895, the last twenty years of his life--he dies in 1915--to build up a set of--a portfolio of power that leaves one with no other conclusion to draw except he was the most powerful black person in the country, undisputed leader of the race. If a newspaper didn't like his ideology and ran editorials, he would buy the newspaper and fire the editors, put his own editors in place, kind of like Rupert--Rupert Murdoch, right? I mean he was a sort of mogul in black America. An advisor to President Teddy--Teddy Roosevelt, much to the great anger and fear of many people in white America.

Now time to ask some critical questions. On one side, you can ask the question, well why did philanthropists chip in?  Was it because of his charm?  Well, I mean, these were businessmen. They--they had their interests at heart here. They saw that Washington was training a fantastic worker base. He'd follow the Washington model, very smart workers, trained in certain skills and crafts, ideal for their mills, factories, and such. And he's also training a permanent second class citizen, so this will be a docile workforce. That's exactly what the factory owners want. A smart workforce is not going to raise any problems.

Now asking a question from the other side--I mean, it's so easy to sort of condemn Washington for all these different--these reasons I've outlined just now, but let's think about where he was living, what he was advocating. What really was possible in the Deep South in the late nineteenth century?  We already talked about lynching, rise of all kinds of laws to wipe out the black vote. The black vote is disappearing radically during this period in the very last years of the nineteenth century. Seventy-five percent of blacks still lived in the Confederate South, and the great majority of that percentage were agricultural workers. Blacks were on the farms. Half of the total southern population was black, but blacks owned just over ten percent of the farms. There was essentially no agricultural education--I mean the Tuskeegees are--the Tuskegee kinds of model are the exceptions--and black farm production is low.

So you have a population that is a grieved population politically, socially, economically, with very limited mobility, almost no mobility, living in a--in a state, one could make the argument, of terror. So when you think about the lived conditions of African Americans, the great majority of them, what were the alternatives, except for try to find a way to develop economic independence, and then in time become recognized as fully participating in the--in the citizenship rights of the United States. What might have been a logical alternative? 


Chapter 3. W.E.B. Du Bois and the Politics of Accommodation and Assimilation [00:29:59]

Well, the alternative to Washington and his accommodationist politics is embodied in W. E. B. Du Bois. Now it's important to remember that Anna Julia Cooper joined the debate first, arguing in A Voice from the South, published in 1892, that the race would be saved by investing in higher education. This comes a full decade before Du Bois steps up to the plate and challenges Washington. But the fact is, for better and for worse, the debate has been crystallized into a Du Bois-Washington debate. Certainly Washington because he was so powerful, and also certainly Du Bois, partly because gender dynamics and our national culture of course, but because the man plays central roles in many different moments of articulating, shifting black politics over the course of the next sixty years.

Du Bois's response to Washington was straightforward. He referred to the Atlanta--Atlanta Cotton Exposition address as the Atlanta Compromise. And he said in his very famous critique of Washington, and I quote here, that,

"manly self respect is worth more than lands and houses, and that a people who voluntarily surrender such respect, or cease striving for it, are not worth civilizing."

Manly self respect is the most important thing. It's more important than lands and houses, and if you don't have the courage to stand up to the system that's fighting, that's pushing you down, you're not worth civilizing. Now this phrasing here is rather important, harkening back to the last two lectures: manliness and civilization. Du Bois embodies this very elitist, Eurocentric world view that supports a manly ideal and thinks it's the--it's the really--it's the real goal to demonstrate one's capacity to act in a civilized fashion, to be civilized, if you're really going to have a chance at entertaining full citizenship rights. Du Bois challenged Washington's call for blacks to give up their political power, their insistence on civil rights, and their desire for the higher education of black youth. Du Bois advocated that the Talented Tenth, this idea he developed from Henry Morehouse, advocated the Talented Tenth be educated at the finest institutions in order to save the race.

Now why is Du Bois so invested in this agenda?  Mainly because it reflected a large part of his own life experience, and a glance at his biography makes this much clearer. Du Bois was born in 1868 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, just about an hour and a half--about an hour and a half from here. It is beginning to be recognized actually, in Great Barrington for being one of its more famous sons, as the phrase might be. He goes to college in the South at Fiske University in Nashville and he gets his PhD at Harvard in 1895, again, that important year, after having studied for some time at Berlin. He publishes the groundbreaking--groundbreaking sociological study called The Philadelphia Negro in 1898, I believe, essentially creating the field of urban sociology in the process, and he helps establish the America Negro Academy.

So just in this--in the moment when Booker T. Washington's rising up, and bursts onto the national scene with his Atlanta Cotton Exposition address, Du Bois is getting the finest education in the world, quite literally, gets his PhD, the very first generation of African Americans to get that degree, establishes the field of urban sociology, helps establish the American Negro Academy, and then starts an academic career for the very first phase of his life, teaching at Atlanta University.

So Du Bois espouses and embodies the value of higher education and the role that the black intellectual would play in the salvation of the race. He was at the time one of the most educated--highly educated people in the world, and he had a very full sense of his own talent--the man had an ego bigger than this room--and his sense of value to the world. He really believed that politically and intellectually engaged scholars were the very best--very best people to interpret the white European world. Again, that idea, sort of that's where the seat of civilization is. And you can see this belief manifested or in the pages of what people regard as Du Bois's great classic, The Souls of Black Folk. How many of you have read The Souls of Black Folk?  Just a handful, well more than a handful. About okay about a sixth of you, fifth of you, sixth of you. Or read in it?  Maybe more hands would go up. It's really amazing, because when I started grad school, I went to grad school here, I was introduced to Du Bois and The Souls of Black Folk in the spring of my first year in grad school. He wasn't part of the undergraduate curriculum, except in just a few kind of strange places. Now it's the undergraduate curriculum like crazy, and I understand it's even being taught in some high schools. I mean this is a radical change in just twenty years, in terms of Du Bois being brought back into our national narrative.

Now The Souls of Black Folk? you have an excerpt from it in the Marable and Mullings reader. I'm not going to belabor the history of that early remarkable book, but I do want to focus on one quick passage, really about the most cited passage of the entire book. And it's--it's a passage that refers to the conundrum of double-consciousness. In Souls of Black Folk, Du Bois recounts his youth growing up in a diverse community where he never felt the sting of race until his adolescence, this very famous moment when he was-- his Valentine's Day card that he was giving to a young woman was refused. He wrote about this dawning awareness of the racial differences in his community, and his own physical appearance, and he said that this awareness amounted to, or he equated it to, a veil that separated the races. And he writes:

"... the Negro is sort of a seventh son, born with a veil, and gifted with second-sight in this American world, a world which yields him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through the revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation, this double-conscious--consciousness, this sense of always looking to one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks through the--excuse me, I skipped a line here-- It is a peculiar sensation, this double--consciousness, this sense of always looking to one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his twoness: an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder."

A veil separating the races. The passage is important for the way in which Du Bois describes the differences in perspective between white and black worlds. As Ralph Ellison would mention some forty or fifty years later in his book, the differences that rendered blacks invisible to white America. I'm referencing Ellison's classic The Invisible Man here. Du Bois says, it is as if this veil keeps blacks hidden from view. But veils, as we know, allow the wearer to see the world outside. This is black America's special gift, according to Du Bois, that they can see America from a perspective that was all but invisible to whites. This gift, however, was also a curse. It kept blacks removed from the daily commerce of culture, society, politics, economics, so forth.


Now why do I linger on this point? I linger on it because it gets to the heart of the problem that Du Bois felt that black scholars like himself had to deal with. They were best positioned to solve these problems, and yet they couldn't be heard and couldn't be seen by the white world, but they were in the best position to interpret those worlds to each other. And in this way, Washington and Du Bois are actually quite alike. They both thought to be interpreters of the black experience to white America. They both sought in some ways to control the means of access of each racial cohort to the other. In the long run, many of their goals were the same. The means, however, were profoundly different.

It's important to say here that Washington was a rather complicated figure. Washington was very publicly in support of the separation of the races, accommodating to northern white business interests. As I mentioned before, he owned all these newspapers, would control them if they said anything bad about him. But he also funneled money to Du Bois and other activists, knowing that public support would destroy him but recognizing that sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes, their points had merit. So he would actually give Du Bois--who had no kind of resource like that--give Du Bois through third parties resources to continue the battle. But in the arena of public engagement, public political engagement, these two could not have been more different.

You can see this in high relief when in 1905, two years after Souls of Black Folk was published, when Du Bois and other college educated black professionals meet at Niagara Falls. Now they're meeting on the Canadian side, not the New York side, which they intended to do, since the New York side refused them lodging. But these black, educated black men and a few women--Ida B. Wells was one of them--come together to form an organization that is dedicated to full citizenship rights for black America. The so called Niagara Movement demanded a number of things: freedom of speech and full citizenship, manhood suffrage, the abolition of all distinctions based on race, the recognition of basic principles of human fellowship, respect for the working person. I went through that quickly. It's in the reader, the manifesto, the Niagara Movement's call to arms. But it's important to--we'll look back at that, and think of these themes that it's talked about. Full citizenship rights, the vote, abolition of distinctions based on race, human fellowship, respect for the working person. I want you to think back to this moment in six or seven weeks--well, in about three or four weeks then six or seven weeks--this is an abiding theme of political organizing in black America throughout much of the twentieth century.

Washington was invited to join the Niagara Movement. He was by far the most powerful black person in the country. He was invited mainly out of courtesy because of his power. He declines. Some of his greatest enemies are the people organizing the Niagara movement, but at least they had to put out that olive branch. But again, Washington knew he would lose his white support base if he made that move. The Niagara Movement meets annually until 1909. That year, some members of the group were invited to a national conference on contemporary race relations and the struggle for civil rights. This group of white activists, many of them with abolitionist roots, back to the previous century, came together because of a race riot and a lynching. Heretofore popularly felt to be a southern phenomenon, despite like the New York City draft riots as evidence to the contrary, this race riot and lynching happened in Springfield, Illinois in 1908.

The riots were horrific in their material significance, certainly, loss of life and property, but the symbolic significance was far greater, at least for these organizers. The riot occurred on the hundredth anniversary of Lincoln's--Abraham Lincoln's birth, and several black citizens in Springfield are lynched within a few blocks of Lincoln's home and within two miles of his gravesite. Now the riot started when a white woman accused a black worker of raping her and assaulting her. She later recanted, admitting that her white boyfriend had beat her, but it was too late. Angry mobs formed and started--started looking for the perpetrator, who was spirited out of town quickly. But the mobs start forming and attacking blacks under the impression that they were the ones harboring the rapist.

That the great emancipator's memory could be so sullied horrified these whites--these white liberals, some of whom organized this conference and invited members of the Niagara Movement. Together, these white liberals and a few representatives, these black liberals from the Niagara Movement, decide to form a new social betterment organization that would be dedicated to the pursuit of civil rights for blacks, and that organization is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored people, the NAACP. Du Bois joined, was one of the people from the Niagara Movement who met-- went to this conference, and he joined the NAACP upon its founding in 1910, and serves as its sole black officer. He was the director of research and publicity for the NAACP, and the editor of its magazine, Crisis. And Du Bois would remain at the NAACP for the next twenty-five years. He would have this very vexed relationship with the organization.

So from its inception, the NAACP needs to be understood as well one, essentially a white organization with Du Bois as the sole black officer, dedicated to the improvement of quality of black life, certainly. But the people running the NAACP, left progressives, some of them considered radicals, were all political agitators, but they were agitating toward an assimilationist goal. This is why Du Bois felt so at home with this sort of politics. The NAACP, not to make light of the commitment of these--these radical progressive and Du Bois as well, agitating towards assimilation, believed that with the proper amount, type, and style of agitation, blacks would eventually integrate into white society, economy, and politics. Now the phrasing of that is very important, that blacks would integrate "into" white society, economy, and politics. The process would not work in reverse.

So just as we can, you know, get worked up, perhaps, about Washington's accommodationist politics and say, you know, we're really down for the idea of Du Bois's radical politics and assimilationist ideals, you need to also be aware of what these assimilationist ideals were about. Blacks would integrate into white society, society that was civilized, and that was a descendant of the height of civilized culture in the world, and that's Britain. These are complicated narratives, but we can ask really interesting questions--or because they're complicated, we can ask really interesting questions, sort of such that when all is said and done, with Washington's politics being open for critique, is it easier to let the Niagara Movement's or the NAACP's politics be free from critique?  There's plenty of criticism to be thrown around and lots of critical questions to ask, and we'll start asking those questions in section and in the weeks to come. Thanks very much. Have a great weekend.
Lecture 7 - Migration and Urbanization [February 1, 2010]
Chapter 1. Sterling Brown Poem: ¡°Old Lem¡± [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  I want to start with a poem, play the audio of it for you. You should listen--you should be able to hear it pretty--pretty well. The poem is called Old Lem by a man named Sterling Brown, one of the great poets in American letters in the twentieth century. He writes the poem after--you know, we're talking this week about the first decade and a half or so of the twentieth century. This poem was written after that, written I think in the nineteen--late twenties or early thirties. I don't remember off the top of my head. But it speaks to the experiences, the rural experiences and the social and political experiences of African Americans. And it certainly is, as you'll hear in the poem, it gives you sort of a context behind why people might not want to stay in the South. The poem is called--called Old Lem.

[Tries to get audio working]:  Good grief.

Sterling Brown: Old Lem

"I talked to old Lem
and old Lem said:
'They weigh the cotton
They store the corn
We only good enough
To work the rows;
They run the commissary
They keep the books
We gotta be grateful
For being cheated;
Whippersnapper clerks
Call us out of our name
We got to say mister
To spindling boys
They make our figgers
Turn somersets
We buck in the middle
Say, 'Thankyuh, sah.'
They don't come by ones
They don't come by twos
But they come by tens.

They got the judges
They got the lawyers
They got the jury-rolls
They got the law
They don't come by ones
They got the sheriffs
They got the deputies
They don't come by twos
They got the shotguns
They got the rope
We git the justice
In the end
And they come by tens.

Their fists stay closed
Their eyes look straight
Our hands stay open
Our eyes must fall
They don't come by ones
They got the manhood
They got the courage
They don't come by twos
We got to slink around
Hangtailed hounds.
They burn us when we dogs
They burn us when we men
They come by tens...

I had a buddy
Six foot of man
Muscled up perfect
Game to the heart
They don't come by ones
Outworked and outfought
Any man or two men
They don't come by twos
He spoke out of turn
At the commissary
They gave him a day
To git out the county
He didn't take it.
He said 'Come and get me.'
They came and got him
And they came by tens.
He stayed in the county--
He lays there dead.

They don't come by ones
They don't come by twos
But they come by tens."

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Again, that's Sterling Brown, poem named Old Lem, talking about forms of southern justice. If you dare to speak back to somebody, if you're black and spoke back to somebody who was white, they might come after you. They would not come by ones or twos; they'd come by tens. What I want to talk about today, having set that really uplifting context for the day's lecture, is talk about the Great Migration and take us forward into the nineteen-teens with the film called The Birth of a Nation. Essentially what I want to do in today's lecture is look at the beginning of a fundamental shift in demographics of black America in--as far as geography's concerned. Black America is still overwhelmingly a rural population, and is overwhelming--overwhelmingly southern. That begins to change and change rather quickly during the Great Migration.


Chapter 2. Organizations that Focused on the Quality of Black Life [00:04:39]

Now I ended last week's lecture talking about the founding of the NAACP, 1909. And I want to point out, the NAACP is not--was not the only organization founded at that--at this time that focused on the quality of black life. Another such organization was the Young Men's Christian Association, and the Young Women's Christian Association. Both groups are highly segregated, but they still played in--a central role in making space available for blacks, particularly black travelers. Housing was provided, hot meals will be provided, community organizing. These become sites of community organizing, much like black churches were playing, still to this day of course, but before that. In fact, with the YMCA, I was on an internship right after college and the internship leader--this is 1989, 1990--the internship leader was talking about when he was coming through L.A. in the 1960s, traveling there for the first time, every black man knew that he had to go to the YMCA if he wanted to find a place to stay. So this is not just the history of the nineteen-aughts and the nineteen-tens and teens. It goes forward all the way and through really the systematic desegregation of society, or at least sort of structurally in the 1960s and seventies.

Anyway, aside from the NAACP, and in addition to the Young Men's and Young Women's Christian Associations, you have one of the most important betterment organizations being founded in this area, and that's the National Urban League, founded in 1911. Now whereas the NAACP dedicated itself to a legal and intellectual strategy, trying to find ways to seek justice for African Americans through legal means and through the idea of sort of civilizing, uplifting society, through the Talented Tenth, the Urban League was explicitly concerned with labor, finding jobs for blacks, sometimes at any cost. The Urban League was chiefly concerned with finding jobs for blacks who newly arrived to urban northern centers. The Urban League was, from the start, less radical than the NAACP. Now to even think of the phrase NAACP and radical going together may sound strange, but it really was sort of an avant garde organization in many ways at its founding. Urban League wasn't in that regard. Some will claim, as you'll see later on, that the Urban League was really quite the opposite, a conservative force in the back pocket of corporate interests, and willing to bust unions in order to put blacks into jobs of any kind.


Chapter 3. The Great Migration [00:07:23]

Now the issue of jobs here can't be overemphasized. Jobs are important in any era to any people, of course, but when you have a large segment of the population, of a socially identified population, black folks in this case, in great flux, jobs become that much more critical. Blacks were that population. They were in profound flux in the first decades of the twentieth century, and it is their mass migration, what is referred to in this era as the Great Migration, and the events that surround that, that form the basis of this week's lectures. Now I want to start with just a clarification of the title, the name of this phenomenon, the Great Migration. At this moment in time, roughly early years of the twentieth century to roughly the start of World War I, this was the greatest internal migration of a people in U.S. history. However, and we'll get to it in a couple of weeks, the migration of African Americans in the 1940s and early fifties way outstrips the migration I'm talking about now but the--in terms of number. But the naming is--the naming convention is such that this early period of migration is called the Great Migration, just to be clear about that fact.

Now aside from naming conventions, I want you to also realize that when I think of the Great Migration, I think of--I think that it needs to be understood as a political movement, that migration itself was a political act. Was it organized in the ways that we think of in terms of high politics or even grassroots protest movements?  No, it wasn't. It wasn't. But it was profoundly political and I wanted to delineate those reasons over the next little bit. It's important to first start to look at the southern black situation at the turn of the century. That's why I played that clip for you, to get a, sort of a sense, at least artistically rendered, of the stakes, of the narrow room within which African Americans could move and move safely in the South.

Blacks who had the option of staying in the South left during the Great Migration because all the political privileges that they had enjoyed during Reconstruction had been systematically stripped away. And I've been talking about this the last couple of weeks. Blacks who had the resources to leave, and that's a big issue, if they had the actual means to get out of town, they might have left just for the fact that, you know, any hope of their having the right to vote and all the other political benefits that come along with that just weren't in the mix any more, not after Redemption, not after the systematic stripping away of the black voting presence. The men couldn't vote any longer. State funded education for blacks was functionally nonexistent. Social segregation was only increasing and there of course was always the looming threat of lynch law.

So lacking even the most basic political rights, some blacks just up and left. Black farmers might have left simply because of the sharecropping system, something else alluded to in this poem by Sterling Brown. Sharecropping, as you already know, a form of employment that looked all too much like slavery. It was a dead end. Better opportunities, the bedrock of any sort of political philosophy, awaited black sharecroppers in the north; at least, this was the thinking. So you have the combination of maybe a little dramatic political death in the South as an option. That's not very viable, so blacks might want to leave. An economic system that's determined to keep them in second class citizenship status. So we think of--of the forces in the South that, or the  reality, the daily lived reality on the ground in the South, you can see that just the determination to leave, to get out, was a response to the political and economic situation. And in that way, the decision, I think, is--can be rendered as sort of a political decision.

And it's interesting if you think about it, sticking on this issue of, you know, the politics of the situation, it's interesting to think about how whites reacted--southern whites reacted to black exodus. At first, in some reg--in some regions, whites were thrilled. "We can finally get the so called negro problem"--this was a popular phrase of the age--"the negro problem would leave once blacks left town."  But rather quickly they realized, "Wait a second. This is our bedrock labor force. This is the force that keeps whites--poor whites placated, because at least they're not black."  The social order was based on color cast and it was being destroyed by black ex--exodus. So whites begin to threaten blacks if they make plans to leave. It sounds completely nonsensical, but this is just the state of the case. And there were white northerners coming down who were labor agents, and white municipalities start charging these labor agencies--I'll explain more about them in a second--exorbitant fees to register to try to get blacks out. It doesn't matter. Labor agents have the resource. Southern whites started seeing their socio--socioeconomic political system, the foundation upon which so much of it was built, starting to crumble with black exodus.

Now historians talk about push, when it comes to the Great Migration, push-pull factors. There's debate whether that's a useful model or not. I'm not going to worry about, sort of, that debate, but I am going to talk about a series of different factors that were at play, that really combine in such a way that make this migration so powerful, so large. You have an infestation, is one of the ways that makes this migration so important, the boll weevil. A little pest that comes up from Mexico, sweeps across Texas and into southeastern US. The boll weevil is a little bug that gets into the boll. cotton boll, B-O-L-L, and destroys it. Cotton wasn't the only crop in the South, but it was the main crop. It was so much of the bedrock of the southern economy was in that agricultural product. Cotton crops get destroyed. There's no work for blacks. They're working the farms. If you can't find work, what's the point of staying around?  I already mentioned political disfranchisement. This job scarcity in the South is also an economic--and the South is essentially an economic colony of the North, and then the North has a decreasing supply of immigrant labor, as you move forward into the twentieth century, as a result of state conflict in European theaters, heading towards World War I. Just take these things together, there's a decreasing reason to stay in the South and the lure of jobs in the North.

Assisting this, or abetting this process even more, are the individuals I mentioned before, labor agents. These are essentially job recruiters employed by people who own factories and mills, mines in the Midwest and the North, who would travel South, since the labor supply was drying up in the North and come into a town--and I'm making up the numbers here--come into a town where there's a, you know, a lot of blacks looking for work and say, "Look, in the North you can own your own house or an apartment. You can vote, sit where you want to on the bus. We've got a job here. The job's going to pay you three dollars a day," unheard of amounts of money. Being able to own property or at least rent property where you want to and ride on the bus, sit where you want to, unheard of possibilities in the South. And they go well we--They said, "Well, we can't afford the train fare to get up to, say Chicago or Cincinnati or Cleveland."  He says, "Don't worry about it. I'll pay for it, and you can work it off."  Or, "Don't even worry about it. I'll just pay for it." 

So labor agents are coming down and signing up a black labor force to come to work in the mines, and factories, and mills. You have, of course, informal lines of communication, people who make, you know that first person to make the trip up to Chicago and saying, "My god, I am making three dollars a day, and I have my own apartment," and writing letters back, or saving up a lot of money and driving down, you know, at the end of the year in their own car, dressed in their fanciest clothes. Talk about the, sort of the quote, land of milk and honey up North. This certainly inspired others to travel. And then you have a very important newspaper, the Chicago Defender, the most important black newspaper of the time. Chicago Defender, of course based in Chicago, but circulated heavily throughout the South. Bags of the Chicago Defender would be bundled up, thrown on trains, and they would appear in say Montgomery or Huntsville or, you know, other southern towns. And they'd be read by who knows how many people.

Now the Defender made it almost a sport talking about lynchings happening in the South. Most often they were about true events. It was an--this was an era of newspapers where you just, you know, made stuff up still. So most often talking about true events in the South and horrible events. And there'd be letters to the editor, sometimes true, often fabricated, but still they were there, written by blacks, written in dialect, but talking about the opportunities in the North and--and reminding folks of the degradation in the South. Chicago Defender's incredibly important as a tool to help people find the courage, or find the resources, or the determination to move north. And then you have service organizations, like the National Urban League, founded in 1911, dedicated to improving the quality of life or life chances for blacks migrating North.

So you have, just in the first two decades, sort of an astonishing convergence of all these different forces that really help fuel this migration. And the numbers are really quite striking. Just between--this is just to get a sense of things. You're not going to have to know this for the--for the like an exam or anything. But looking at a few major northern cities, between 1910 and 1920--it's so funny when I say you don¡¯t have to know this for the exam, the tapping stops. That's hysterical. Anyway, you take New York City, in 1910, the population--the African American population is around ninety thousand. Within ten years, it's one hundred and fifty thousand, an increase of sixty-six percent. In Chicago, the population increases by one hundred and--almost one hundred and fifty percent from fortry-four thousand to one hundred and ten thousand. In Cleveland, population soars from eight thousand to thirty-four thousand, an increase of three hundred percent. And in Detroit, the population goes from five thousand to forty thousand,  population--an increase of six hundred percent. So radical changes in just a ten year period of time. This is the era when Harlem becomes known as a black enclave.

Now, so we know what was getting people out of the South. What did they find when they got to the North?  Yeah, they could have their own apartments, certainly. Owning homes would take a little while for most migrants, but they would find segregated housing, de facto. Not de jure, de facto. And segregated housing was bad housing, low quality, poorly maintained, sites of high levels of crime, vice, public health hazards. Anybody know Washington DC that well, sort of the area?  Well Georgetown used to be, you know, a sort of slum in--in the docks, but getting around say Dupont Circle and heading that area, a lot of townhouses around there, row houses. And where I'm talking about, you would go behind the row houses to the interior of the block and these alley dwellings. I mean pestilence, horrible sights, horrible locations. This is where a lot of migrant blacks lived in the alleys in Washington DC, sort of the invisible to the public, but certainly there.

Migrants to the North would find native black resistance, people who'd been there already for generations who thought these black migrants talked funny, dressed strangely, cooked food that smelled wrong, and were loud and boisterous and acted out in public. All these kind of racially coded things we certainly still live with, but you have long term black communities deeply unhappy about these migrants coming up. You'd have people who had migrated just ten years earlier unhappy about the new migrants, because "they're just making--they're embarrassing us,they're making increasing job competition."  Coming up was--was filled with challenges. You would also have, you know, an Urban League trying to find people jobs. You would have African Americans being brought up to a factory where a labor union, which blacks weren't allowed to join, and the union being on strike, and the Urban League working with the company that owns the factory saying--the factory owner saying, "Look, if you can get me one hundred black men to work in the factory, that would be great. I'll give them jobs."  Well, they're hired as scab labor, so they are vilified by white labor workers. It's a job, certainly, as long as the labor union stays on strike. But it's a job at some pretty serious costs, as we'll see in this week's readings and in Wednesday's lecture.

So life wasn't easy and you have to think about this tension between, sort of, black autonomy, the real power in being able to make a decision to leave town. You can't discount that. That's important, sort of life changing in a sense, just to get up and go. You have to weigh that against the reality of like life when you got to your destination might be pretty horrible as well. Certainly different than anything you expected. Yeah, you got paid more, yeah, you had your own roof over your head, but the tenements in which blacks were living were just, I mean, horrible. I mean the stuff beyond your imagination in so many ways. Sure, you could ride where you wanted to on the bus, but there are still costs or risks involved in acting out, shall we say. Again, we'll see more of this in the next lect--in the next lecture.

Now one thing I--I also want to make clear before moving into the next phase of the lecture is thinking about, as we're trying to unpack what migration really was, it's important to realize that migration wasn't just blacks working on the southern farms, all of a sudden, you know, in a week's time, they're working in a mill in Chicago. No, it wasn't that. I mean migration was, among the many things, at least--I mean it was at least very complicated. So you might have some working in the farm. The boll weevil attacks; there's no more opportunity to work. You'd--you'd go to the city, a southern city, trying to find a job, something. Cities became crowded. This is where labor agents would really steal--quote, steal. You would find a lot of people, hire them up to the North.

But would they always go all the--all, quote, all the way to north to Chicago or New York City?  No, they wouldn't. They might end up in the coalfields in West Virginia, or in Ohio, or in Kentucky. And they might work there for, you know, six months and then go back home to Montgomery, just pick a place. And then they might leave the next year for three months and then come back. Migration was not literally from field to factory in one straight direction. People were going back and forth often. They might get up to, you know, the mines--the coalmines in Kentucky, be there for a couple years and then make it to Chicago after that, and who knows how long they would stay?  So you need to understand that--that--that migration is doing--moving in many different directions at once, although it was generally from field to generally to factory.


Chapter 4. D.W. Griffith Film: ¡°The Birth of a Nation¡± [00:26:02]

One thing that's not ambiguous at all during this era is what I'll say, the commerce of racism. Remember, whites didn't want to have blacks leave--or whites wanted blacks to leave at first, then realized, "Wait, this would mess up our system," then don't want blacks to leave at all. Yet they still treat blacks pretty shabbily in their southern towns and in their southern fields. One thing that is incumbent upon this sort of commerce of racism is control. Who's in control of society?  It's a word I've used before. And society becomes destabilized by blacks moving on their own or with the help of labor agents, you start seeing a real rise in white resistance to the challenge to this system. White resistance to black autonomy becomes palpable. I already mentioned southern resistance to labor agents coming down. It's important to understand there are other things that were developing within white America--white southern America that complicated the nature of black-white relations in the South, and that--the most important force is the Klan, the KKK.

Now the Klan, you'll remember, was destroyed at the national level during Reconstruction. It starts to creep back during Redemption, but it's really, you know, as terrible--terrifying as it is, something happens when you get to around the height of the migration, around 1915. The popularity of the Klan skyrockets, I mean skyrockets. The fact that it's happening at the same time blacks are trying to leave the South, in a real outflow, is no coincidence. There's no doubt also that a large part of the Klan's popularity, reborn popularity, is a film, D. W. Griffith's film called The Birth of a Nation. This movie is based on a novel by a guy named Thomas Dixon--Dixon, a novel called The Clansman. The book as well as the movie, and I'll only be talking about the movie, is a depiction of Reconstruction, but from a point of view that was entirely sympathetic to the southern community, southern mentality. The film was immediately controversial. It was explicitly racist, but there's no denying the fact that it was cinematically revolutionary.

Let's cast inside the subject matter for a moment. It may be the most important film, most important American film of all time, for the way it changed what was possible from a technical point of view. We have large outdoor scenes, the tracking shot, cat's eye lenses, fade ins, color, or more like tinting, but still color, night photography, panning, close ups, high angle shots, and so forth. It was also the first feature length film in American motion picture history. So technically, it's an astonishing accomplishment. When it's shown at the White House, Woodrow Wilson, southern Democrat but also a scholar of some merit, declared that it was, quote, "history written in lightning."  He lauded it for its bold and accurate depiction of the past. Now for the record, its only accuracy came in the fact that it represented a type of hysterical psychology that captivated southerners who felt that they were victims of a war of northern aggression.

So Woodrow Wilson celebrates this thing, this is, you know, this is an incredible historical document. It is an incredible historical document, but not for what it shows on this--not for the story it tells, but for how it captures a mentality in the nineteen-teens, and how it excites a populist, I guess, I guess a populist base in white America and helps elevate membership numbers in the Klan. I mean the film is hailed--and speaking of two sides, from the technical standpoint, Spike Lee, ever the controversial artist, talked about it as the most important film that he's ever--I mean it was so--the most important film for him. On the other side of it, in terms of, you know, what the film was really about, it's still used by the Klan today as a recruiting tool. So it's not just this interesting silent movie from the nineteen-teens. It's still being used today.

Now the basic storyline tracks the rise and fall of the South, as told through the experiences of two different families. You have a family called the Stoneman the Stoneman family from the North, and the Cameron family from the South. So lifelong friends, both very powerful families, but divided by the Mason-Dixon line. A little bit of Romeo and Juliet to the story, in that the different sets of Stoneman and Cameron children are in love with each other. So the love crosses the--the Northern and South divide. And so the Stonemans and Camerons stand in as metaphors for the entire North-South division. These are divisions that--these are parts of the country that should love each other. They are in one spirit in some way, but there's a fundamental rupture and we need to solve that rupture.

So the premise is that the Camerons, these are the southerners, give three sons to the war. Only one survives, a guy named Ben, who then avows--vows to avenge southern dishonor, but he also happens to fall in love with--this makes it complicated--one of the Stoneman daughters, northern daughter. So the sole surviving southern male of the Cameron clan falls in love with the Stonemans' daughter. On the northern side, the Stonemans lose one son to the war, and the other son remains in love with the Cameron girl, so you see this crossing. After the war, Austin Stoneman, the family patriarch and member of Congress, comes down South and puts the power hungry and corrupt Silas Lynch--that's his name. It's not a subtle film in any stretch of the imagination--Silas Lynch happens to be of mixed race, but has a particular craving for white women. He puts Silas Lynch in charge of the liberated slaves in the Camerons' home town of Piedmont, and the Piedmont blacks, now having the right to vote, raise all sorts of trouble for the local whites, and especially affected were the Camerons, these southerners.

The film tracks this history, the rise of Reconstruction governments, run by unprepared and unqualified blacks. It depicts blacks' social and political intransigence and the systematic disenfranchisement of southern whites. And Birth of a Nation also gives us a cautionary tale of what happens when black men are freed and find themselves around white women. We'll see this most clearly in the actions of Gus, a properly mannered servant for the Camerons prior to emancipation, who becomes a leering threat with the conclusion of the Civil War. Despite Ben Stoneman, the surviving young man in the southern family in the Civil War--despite Ben Stoneman's warnings to Gus to leave his family alone and despite Ben's warning to his younger sister Flora to stay in the house and thus remain safe, tragedy strikes.

Gus stalks Flora when she leaves the home to get water from a stream in the woods. Flora sees Gus stalking her and runs for her life, knowing--and this is all very clearly implied in the film--that if Gus caught her, she would be raped. Flora finds herself at a cliff's edge, while calling for help, as Gus--Gus inches closer. She avoids certain rape by leaping to her death. She dies in her brother's arms, and Ben, already determined to restore the South's honor, goes after Gus. It will come to no surprise to you, I think, that Gus is lynched. The castration scenes in the film were actually cut in the final print. And Ben, already inspired about how to create a gang of southerners to avenge the South's honor, organizes the Klan in an--in an explicit move to social control, the protection of white womanhood and--and the Redemption of the South.

Now the story isn't just about the tangled love relationship that spans the Civil War. It's also about representation of blacks and their quest for full citizenship rights and the real object that defined that quest, which was the white woman. It's also a story about romanticizing and justifying the rise of the Klan, the role in the salvation of white womanhood and therefore southern dignity. Now spliced together, I was doing--giving you all this background so you'll make sense of what you're about to see. I spliced together three different scenes from the movie to help you get a better understanding of what's at stake here. You should not look at the movie--the film so much for its interpretation of the fall and rise of the South. That is patently false. What's worth thinking about is the particular interpretation of blackness, of dignity, of citizenship, of intelligence, objectification, etcetera,. how they all became an object of fascination when it was released. The movie was a runaway hit, played to sold out audiences around the country, even though it charged what was then the exorbitant price of seventy-five cents to two dollars a ticket to get in.

<<Silent movie plays>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  This is the Stoneman family coming down to the South to recuperate from bad health, and the Stoneman and the Cameron children see each other, greet each other. And yes, they're in black face when they are appearing black. That's Ben Cameron on the right, with his love in the middle and his sister, the young one who kills herself, on the left. That's the first clip. I don't--I confess, I don't know what happened. I was playing it this morning, getting it ready, and there's no sound for this. So it's just--it's just music playing in the background. Down here it says, "an historical facsimile at the State House of Representatives of South Carolina as it was in 1870, after a photograph by the Columbia State."  Basically, blacks are now in control and this is what happens.

You'll see the fade in. This has technically never been done before. You'll have a mix of characters here in black face and actually black actors. A depiction of the morality of black representatives, drinking on the floor, eating either a turkey leg or a large chicken leg, not knowing how to comport themselves. You know, these are the things that are important to black representatives. White have to salute. There's general chaos. They're not properly behaved. But there are some representatives, and you can see them there, sitting there quietly. The close in shot like that, again, brand new. Blacks and whites in the gallery. You start seeing here a depiction of what the actual desire of black representatives happens to be, and their reaction. That's Silas Lynch in the middle, and at the bottom of the screen there for a second you saw him. A mixed race man that's come down to take control of the South.

And this final clip right here. His sister's already died, died in his arms. This is Ben Cameron. He sees these young white children playing with the black children, dressed up as piccaninnies with their hair and such. And it's hard to see on the screen, but their eyes get bug eyed, and they're terrified. Like I said, it wasn't the most subtle of films. And so you see your depictions of black depravity, of desire for white women. You also see, of course, the loyal servants who are, sort of, the Mammy figure, the--the heavyset black woman, again these characters--these main characters in black face. You didn't see much of it, Silas Lynch. I pointed him out to you, but the mixed race individual, that's northern--appointed by a northern representative to come down and take control of the South, and he desires white women. Gus, the servant, who made eyes at the Mammy figure, is the one who desires white women, once he's armed as a member of the northern militia.

The fear embodied in this film, the anxiety, is what I really want you to take away from it, and the fact that the film was terrifically popular. It wasn't just popular as a--as an organizing tool for the Klan. It was the top grossing film. I mean I don't know if this statistic is still true in our Avatar age, and some people actually see connections to Avatar and the kind of racial logic of a film like Birth of a Nation. But the film, off of seventy-five cent and two dollar tickets, earns over ten million dollars in its first release. Unbelievable amounts of money. And it also earned the specific attention of the young--of the young NAACP, which lauded--which issued a forty-seven page pamphlet titled Fighting a Vicious Film: Protest Against The Birth of the Nation. They would hold rallies at the theater, wherever the film was being shown, protesting its screening. And it famously referred to the film as "three miles of filth." 

This is the state of the--the culture at the moment. Black Americans in--in flux, migration not happening in a uniform direction or at a uniform pace, but happening, clearly. Detroit's black population blossoms by six hundred percent in a ten year span. Black enclaves in places that didn't--they just simply weren't there before are now there. So the reorganizing, repopulating of black America is beginning here and continues in earnest until around the 1970s when the--when the population numbers begin to settle--settle down, the migration--migration numbers settle down. And actually, we're in an age where the migration is reversing for the first time since this--since the start of the twentieth century. We're not exactly sure why yet as far as demographers. We're dealing with a radical shift of population and, and related to that, a radical rise in social anxieties and a determination to control it. And we'll see how that control is manifested beyond the Klan and Birth of a Nation on Wednesday's lecture. Thank you.
Lecture 8 - Migration and Urbanization (continued) [February 3, 2010]
Chapter 1. W.E.B. Du Bois Editorial: "Close Ranks" [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  So you remember that I began the last lecture playing a poem by Sterling Brown called Old Lem, documenting the kinds of local social trauma and challenges that African Americans had to face in a sharecropping South. At least, that's sort of the context that Old Lem evokes for me. And I talked about the--the rise of the NAACP and the Great Migration, the forces conspiring it, and also closed--and then closed with some vignettes from The Birth of a Nation to give you a sense of--sort of a tactile sense of a mentality in the nineteen-teens that reflects sort of the racial passions of the age, maybe to put a poetic turn on it. Today's lecture's really going to focus chiefly at the--the very in--between 1918 and 1920 or so, essentially, kind of bringing together all these different strands of social, political, economic tension and watching how they present themselves to a national, international audience.

I'm going to start here in 1918, move back a bit through 1917, go into 1919, just so you sort of follow the trajectory of the lecture. Also my apologies, I'm battling a head cold and I'm hoping that I can get through all this without being too congested. Anyway, this--I'm gonna title this lecture, I call it "World War I and the Red Summer."  In 1918, W. E. B. Du Bois, the Director of Research for the NAACP and the editor of the NAACP's journal, Crisis, you know, the great leader of the American Negro Academy, the author of Souls of Black Folk. Du Bois writes an editorial. The editorial is called "Close Ranks."  Now in writing for the NAACP, it's supposed to be a non-partisan organization, although it had a progressive political agenda when it comes to racial matters. But Du Bois, over the course of his three decades or so of continuous affiliation with the NAACP, frequently ruffled the feathers of NAACP leaders for his independence and--and essentially his shifting political ideologies being--being articulated in Crisis? through these editorials. "Closed Ranks" is one of the more famous early ones. This is an excerpt from it. So he's talking about World War I. The U.S. is not yet involved. But he's saying,

"This is the crisis--this is the crisis of the world. We of the colored race have no ordinary interest [coughs] --excuse me-- We of the colored race have no ordinary interest in the outcome. That which the German power represents today spells death to the aspirations of Negroes and all darker races for equality,  freedom and democracy. Let us not hesitate. Let us, while this war lasts, forget our special grievances and close our ranks shoulder to shoulder with our own white fellow citizens and the allied nations that are fighting for democracy. We make no ordinary sacrifice, but we make it gladly and willingly with our eyes lifted to the hills."

"This is the crisis of the world. Let us, while this war lasts, forget our special grievances and close our ranks shoulder to shoulder with our white citizens and the allied nations that are fighting for democracy.

This is Du Bois's basic call to black Americans to invest their faith in the promise of American democracy. The thinking was, by demonstrating the epitome of patriotic--the patriotic act, risking your life for your country, African Americans would--would--this demonstration would certainly translate into civil rights injustice at home once the war ended. Risk your life for the sake of the country, and the country will respect it and honor that sacrifice. Many black leaders were angry with Du Bois, and this is why I sort of preface this commentary on the editorial, that this should not be seen as the opinion of the NAACP necessarily, but Du Bois's opinion. Many black leaders were upset with Du Bois because they didn't think that he was acting in the best wishes or the best--in the best spirit of the race. And while they didn't think he was quite acting like Booker T. Washington, who has just passed away about three years at this point, they were astonished that he could find it reasonable to ask blacks--to ask blacks to forget their special grievances.

We've already gone over these special grievances, of course, listed over the course of the last few weeks, a litany of problems generally associated with black life in the South, still largely a southern population. Those grievances hadn't changed. What I want to do today in laying out this narrative is talk about these grievances as they were located in other places, the Midwest to a certain extent, but also more generally the North. I mean this is the moment of the migration. This builds upon that issue of, you know, what is it that blacks found when they landed in these new--new areas and new cities?  Now as I made clear, I hope, in the last lecture, black migration was due to a range of factors, but jobs were one of the most important of these factors. You know, there's the political intransigence of the South, of course, the terror and lynch law, but jobs were really one of the animating--core animating features.
Chapter 2. East St. Louis in 1917 [00:06:43]

Blacks migrating to the North or to the cities in search of work often burdened social services--social service agencies, who were trying to help out the needy. Blacks' arrival in Northern, Midwestern cities placed extra pressures on housing, and blacks' presence increasingly exacerbated labor tensions. It's not surprising. You think back to the New York City draft riots with which I began this class. Blacks' presence on the laboring scene created anxiety among those who were already working. In all of these regards, in overburdened social service agencies helping out the poor and the needy, housing issues, labor issues, in all of these regards, you can see events in East St. Louis forming into a powder keg.

July 2nd in 1917, East St. Louis: labor agents have recruited successfully thousands of blacks to work in the East St. Louis's aluminum factories, and they were hired, as I mentioned on Monday, in this case, blacks were hired to replace striking white workers. These were scab workers. The striking workers were furious, of course. The bosses knew they had a great card to play, the race card in this case, and they used race to divide the workers. Blacks weren't allowed in the unions, so this didn¡¯t help matters out at all, and union organizers raised the cry of, I quote here, "Nigger scab" as blacks were going into the aluminum factories. As blacks were going in, these scab workers going into the--the factories, fights break out and quickly turn from a local, you know, fistfight or so to just open violence, going throughout much of East St. Louis. The police force, largely white, they're not surprised at any of this happening, but decide to look the other way, as whites begin to assault blacks by clubbing them, hitting them, stabbing them.

When the dust settles down, we know that nine whites and at least forty blacks died in the riots in East St. Louis. And I say at least forty blacks. If you look at eyewitness accounts, you start seeing wide discrepancies of numbers. And really, what's unknown is how many blacks died. I mean, I'm sure it could be more whites as well, but particularly blacks in this case, since there are eyewitness accounts of their bodies being thrown into ditches and never recovered, being thrown into the Mississippi River and never recovered. So we don't know how many people died in the riots, really. We do know that thousands of black families were left homeless because of these St. Louis riots. And we also know that the massacre did not go unnoticed.

Some three weeks after the riots, we're talking late July at this point, the NAACP organized a silent march down New York City's Fifth Avenue. Being led by muffled drums, ten thousand men, women, and children marched from Harlem to the heart of Manhattan in dead silence, simply carrying banners like, and I quote here, "Mr. President, why not make America safe for democracy?" or, "Mother, do lynchers go to heaven?"  There's a couple of images here from the silent march, again led by drummers, not a single sound, just a simple beat. And this is what I'll just call a Men's Auxiliary. Just the men were marching separately, carrying banners about anti--you know, protesting racial violence. Dressed in their respectable best. And in the same march, sort of the Women's Auxiliary, women and children marching together, you know, as far as the eye can see, looking up Fifth Avenue, marching down. The silent protest, cause no one was going to hear their cries out loud, it seemed.
Chapter 3. Chicago in 1919 [00:11:44]

Now East St. Louis, as it turned out, would prove to be just the start of things. Two years later, 1919, the country would go through what has been called the Red Summer. Now the name didn't come from the reference to communism, in this case, but rather was drawn from the amount of blood that was shed. Violence breaks out in twenty-five cities in a six month period in 1919. Some of the violence happens in the South. Some of these riots happen in the South, but the majority of the violence happens in the Midwest and North. And the worst riots in your reading this week, the sort of classic book on the occasion--the worst riots happened in Chicago in 1919, in July of 1919. You have in Chicago a five-day battle between whites and blacks, ethnic enclaves of whites fighting against blacks.

Now Chicago, as you know from reading the book, is a little bit different from St. Louis--East St. Louis in this regard, in that the battle in Chicago is not really over labor tensions, per se. Certainly there are tensions in the factories, but not--not like East St. Louis. The riots aren't started out of scab workers trying to break a union, or being used to break a union. In Chicago, the largely--the riots largely are sparked by housing tensions. Now the spark comes out of the ugly--an ugly racial incident. A young black boy goes to Lake Michigan to enjoy a break from the heat of the summer. He goes to the segregated beach and trudges out into the water. Now if you know Lake Michigan, it looks like an ocean when you're at the--at the shore. He goes out into the water and strays over some unmarked line. I can't really say it was imaginary. People knew that it was there, I suppose. He strays over some unmarked line separating the races in the water. A group of white boys start throwing stones at him from the shore. He drowns in the assault.

News about the murder starts sweeping across Chicago, and street gangs, made up of white ethnics, start roving about with the stated purpose of defending their turf. So you already know the tension's there, and this might be a spark they're recognizing of something really horrible happening, based on the violence happening in other cities. So these street gangs start to--they're sort of spread out to defend their territories. There's already a history of first wave blacks, you know, the first to enter into a white, say Irish neighborhood, let's say, or an Italian neighborhood, to try to find a place to live, because they were running out of spaces to--to live in the so called black belt of Chicago. There's a history of houses being firebombed. We'd rather burn down a house and risk burning down a block, actually, than have this black family move in. There are all kinds of threats when blacks try to de facto integrate white neighborhoods, and now things simply escalated.

In the course of the ensuing--ensuing five-day riot, at least forty people were killed. Two-thirds of them were black. Thousands more, over five thousand, are injured, mostly black, and thousands of families are left homeless. Much like in East St. Louis, police stood by and let white mobs attack blacks. There's some striking pictures of this in--in Tuttle's book. Only when the Illinois National Guard is brought in does peace return to the city. It takes days. But there's a slightly different element to this riot, as far as in sort of the heat of the moment, not its causative factors. It's that you had such a dense population--a large and dense population of black enclaves. When these white gangs start moving into territories beyond their own turf, like the South Side of Chicago, it was not uncommon during these riots for blacks to set upon them, to defend their turf. So while blacks overwhelmingly--overwhelmingly suffered at the hands of whites during the Chicago riot, one can see a new militancy in the mentality arising among blacks. And to trace this new mentality, and this actually propels us into next week's lectures on the New Negro. To trace this new mentality, we need to go back to the start of World War I and Du Bois's call to close ranks.
Chapter 4. The Start of World War I and Du Bois¡¯ Call to Close Ranks [00:16:53]

Although black leaders criticized Du Bois for his editorial, many blacks did heed his call and signed up for duty. Ultimately, around three hundred thousand black men served; half of them serve in Europe during the US involvement in World War I. A call for black officers is made. This is a rather bold departure, and to white officials' surprise, is actually answered. But now we have a problem. How are you going to train black soldiers?  I've been talking about the North here, but as it happens, this is really a Southern story at this point, because so many of the country's forts and training grounds are Southern. Southerners had fears of "armed negroes," as the phrase would have been, particularly Northern blacks who were now being given guns, who would be quick to anger, they suspected, over how they might be treated in southern towns. They weren't worried so much about black soldiers, say from Chicago, being trained down in a base in Alabama, as long as they were on the base. They weren't so much concerned about that. But, you know, people leave the base and they might go into the city. And if they were expecting to be served at a counter, or to go in the front door of a bus, or go in the front door of a restaurant and they weren't allowed, they're worried about what might result.

So counter to established military doctrine, or so I understand it, instead of training as entire divisions altogether, divisions were broken up and trained in smaller quantities. They'd be reorganized overseas into their proper military structure, but they also--and they--these are black troops I'm talking about here--weren't always fighting under the U.S. flag. They trained with French troops. They'd be sent over there to train with French troops and fight under the French flag. So when these black troops trained in un--in unorthodox ways in the U.S. South, in the U.S., get reorganized into proper divisions in the European theater, the great majority of them in France, some fighting under the French flag, when they are not in battle, if they're on, if they have some leave perhaps and they go into a city or a town in France, they have--an interesting thing starts to happen, is that they're treated like citizens.

Black soldiers in France would tell stories all the time about--about having their first true feeling of liberty when they were in France. All the white officers and government--government officials, and white offers under--under command to act this way, certainly, they did all that they could do to prevent it. They were still being welcomed by French citizens, and people coming to their rescue. Now there are plenty of stories about white officers fraternizing with black officers in France, in, say, a local restaurant, because the white officer says, "You know, I don't care what the color of your skin are--is. You happen to be--We're fighting side by side. We're doing the same kind of job."  There's plenty of those stories. I'm not going to categorize all blacks and all whites working a certain way. But there were orders issued about how officers were supposed to control black troops. For example, in 1918, a secret memo was sent to the French military mission that was written by French authorities, but under pressure and after approval by U.S. military authorities, that's making clear how French troops should deal with black soldiers.

"The French public has become accustomed to treating the Negro with familiarity and indulgence. This indulgence and this familiarity are matters of grievous concern to Americans. They consider them an affront to their national policy. They are afraid that contact with the French will inspire in black Americans aspirations to which to the whites appear intolerable. It is of the utmost importance that every effort be made to avoid profoundly estranging American opinion."

The directive then goes on to list a set of conclusions which I excerpt briefly here. The first conclusion is that, "we must prevent the rise of any pronounced degree of intimacy between French officers and black officers."  "We must prevent the rise of any intimacy," I mean they're talking just hanging out and socializing between French officers and black officers. "We must not commend too highly the black American troops, particularly in the presence of white Americans."  And another conclusion: "Americans become greatly incensed at any public expression of intimacy between white women with black men."  That same specter arises again. Do not socialize with black officers. Do not--do not commend the troops--the black troops too much, especially in the presence of white Americans. And recognize that Americans get very uneasy, "incensed" it said, at the public expression of intimacy between white women, in this case it would be French women, and black troops. It's really profound, the extent to which the military and the government's trying to preserve its social order, even overseas.
Chapter 5. W.E.B. Du Bois Editorial: ¡°Returning Soldiers¡± [00:23:47]

Well, despite these entreaties, black soldiers are welcomed as heroes in France, and they return to the U.S. quite reasonably with expectations that justice will be theirs, full citizenship rights, since they had risked their lives for the country. For a moment, in truth, it actually looked like things might be better. When the three hundred and sixty-ninth, the first black contingent to fight in the war, the vision that was known as the Hellfighters, the three sixty-ninth, known also for its distinction on the battlefield. When it returns to the U.S. in 1919, roughly one million people watched them parade from the Lower--from Lower Manhattan docks, up Fifth Avenue into Harlem. The symbolism of--I hope you already get it. It's no small irony in the fact that this is a shift in the direction from the very famous silent protest of ten thousand black men, and women, and children, marching down Fifth Avenue just two years earlier in the wake of the East St. Louis race riots. But now black soldiers are returning as heroes, welcomed by a million people. Change of direction. A change of the notion of who belongs and of citizenship rights and possibility. As it turns out, however, their early optimism was proven wrong quite quickly.

After a decline of several years, over the course of several years, the number of lynchings skyrocket in 1919. Certainly this might be in part of--due to the popularity of Birth of a Nation and the rise of the Klan. The Klan really hits its peak around 1920 to twenty-two, but it's also quite clear that 1919 is an important marker as far as this is concerned, because of the over eighty-plus recorded lynchings--recorded. There were certainly more--of the recorded eighty-plus lynch victims, at least ten of them were returning soldiers, most of whom were murdered while in their uniform. So the very thing that Southern towns were afraid of happening manifested itself in reality, but in a weird--in a weird sort of way, and certainly a miserable sort of way, Southern towns are afraid, "What are we going to do with these Northern black troops with guns?  They might start shooting at us and raising hell." 

Well, I guess their answer, out of their anxiety, was that when these officers or--officers or troops came back, whether they were Northern or Southern, they felt that now they had earned the right to walk in the front door of the restaurant and to get served. They felt they had the right to walk in the front door of the bus instead of the back door of the bus. They felt they had the right to socialize with whomever they wanted to. This was the world they'd become accustomed to in France, and, after all, they had risked their lives in this miserable war. And some of these soldiers were lynched while in uniform for doing just such things as innocuous as talking back to bus drivers, talking to white women, insisting on being served. This is social control at the most grotesque level. Du Bois, you'll remember, had advocated that African Americans should forget their special grievances, just a year earlier--two years earlier--a year earlier, excuse me. And he sees reports of black soldiers being treated like this, and black citizens, not soldiers, being treated like this, and he realizes he made a grave error. So he writes a new editorial called "Returning Soldiers."  And it says, in part, of course,

"Today we return. We return from the slavery of uniform which the world's madness demanded us to don to the freedom of civil garb. We stand again to look America squarely in the face and call a spade a spade. We sing: This country of ours, despite all its better souls have done and dreamed, is yet a shameful land.

It lynches. It disfranchises its own citizens. It encourages ignorance. It steals from us. It insults us.

This is the country to which we, soldiers of democracy, return. This is the fatherland for--for which we fought!  But it is our fatherland. It was right for us to fight. The faults of our country are our faults. Under similar circumstances, we would fight again. But by the God of Heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if now that that war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land.

We return. We return from fighting. We return fighting.

Make way for democracy! We saved it in France, and by the Great Jehovah, we will save it in the United--in the United States of America, or know the reason why."

I don't want to make too much of this editorial. It's an editorial, after all. Crisis was an important magazine. It was very popular. Its readership is skyrocketing, there's no doubt about that, but it is just an editorial, right? 
Chapter 6. Claude McKay Poem: If We Must Die [00:30:12]

Well, if you look at a range of different events, whether it's political, social, economic, violence in the race riots of 1917, particularly 1919, if you look at a mentality that's being expressed by soldiers who had fought in the fields of Europe, trench warfare, and come--come back with a heightened sense of what is rightfully theirs, quite reasonably of course, you start to see an insistence. Some certainly called it an impatience, but an insistence amongst black citizens to actually have the rights which they had as American citizens. Blacks still suffered terrible discrimination. They had difficulty securing jobs or decent housing. But with the shock of lynched--lynched soldiers, more than anything else perhaps, the new anger voiced by leaders like Du Bois, there was a clear sense that a new political climate that was about to appear, that insisted more ardently than ever, in fact, that blacks would have their civil rights, that they would have their place at the table, or else.

Now this sentiment is captured most eloquently by poet Claude McKay, who wrote the famous anthem, If We Must Die, in 1919. I actually have it on--on disc, on a--from iTunes. I could play it, but this poem is rather dramatic, and daunting, and challenging. And as it turns out, Claude McKay's voice is not any of those things. It sounds really--I was so disappointed when I played it the first time, expecting all this great drama, and it's kind of very high pitched and kind of--it just doesn't--it lacks the drama. So with apologies to Claude McKay, I'll read it myself, actually.

[students laugh]

I can't write like him, but I can read the--I can read the poem with a more--a more appropriate voice, I'll say. Claude McKay writes If We Must Die in 1919, and I mean the timing is no accident. It's in response to the violence that's--that's--that's being visited upon blacks with--with a routine that is sort of almost mind numbing, violence being visited upon them by the, you know, soldiers being lynched and violence being visited upon them by the--the riots in East St. Louis and Chicago, and also the persistent sort of social and psychological violence that says, "You do not belong," that you are an alien in your own land. Claude McKay writes:

"If we must die--let it not be like hogs

Hunted and penned to an inglorious spot,

While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,

Making their mock at our accursed lot.

If we must die--oh, let us nobly die,

So that our precious blood be not shed

In vain; then even the monsters we defy

Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!

Oh, Kinsmen!  We must meet the common foe;

Though far outnumbered, let us show us brave,

And for their thousand blows deal one deathblow!

What though before us lies the open grave?

Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack,

Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!"

This poem becomes an anthem for a new mentality, certainly amongst artist-intellectuals from 1919 moving forward. One thing that's important, and I want to end on this note. And it's--I confess it's ending a little earlier than I expected, but I want to end on this note, because it brings together many different strands. The poem is one of social consciousness, of course. It's in response to the violence that--that Claude McKay has witnessed, or has been reading about certainly. But what you start--what, what you see happening at this, sort of this nexus is the voice of artists--what you're going to see, I should say, is the voices of artists and intellectuals rising to the forefront, and ushering in this new age of what I'll just call cultural insistence on being heard. That's something we'll be talking about next week when we get to the New Negro Renaissance, more famously or more commonly known as the Harlem Renaissance.

This, although the--I'm getting ahead of myself here. The renaissance, the periodizing of the renaissance is a complicated matter. We can look at this poem in this political moment, in this violent moment, in the moment when the soldiers march up Fifth Avenue to throngs, while some people in that audience were getting ready to kill them. A moment of new awareness, a new racial voice on the American scene. I'm actually going to stop there, but I'm happy to take questions, or if not, we can go our merry ways. Are there any questions at all?

Yes?

Student:  To what extent were communists like, for instance, McKay, militants?  In other words, did they--did they condone the use of violence, or were they just in favor of protesting?

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Well what they're in favor--what the question is dealing with, you know, the link or the connection between communists and militancy and advocacy of violence. I think it's--a simple way to put it is that what communism is is in a state of profound flux. It's just being articulated, you know, at this moment, and you're going to see more of that going through the 1920s into the 1930s. [looks down] Oops. But the--so whether some advocated--some communists advocated violence, some advocated something else, it just depends on the--on the individual. McKay and others, you know these people who traveled to Russia and then the Soviet Union, trying to find answers, you actually have--and I'm glad you asked it, because I won't be talking about it so much in this class, I don¡¯t think--you have throughout the 1920s, thirties, and into the forties, mostly in the 1930s, certainly the rise of pop--the popular rise of Communism amongst black Americans. I'll say something about that later on. But you actually have a large number of African Americans, especially professionals, who become card carrying communists, but never talk about it loudly, because they'll lose their jobs. A lot of teachers, especially, and certainly many more who were sympathetic to Communism.

Now were they sympathetic to it because they advocated a class struggle?  For many of them no, because they were occupying a niche in black America that accrued benefits. You know, these were the middle-class in many ways. But were they--they were seeking civil rights. And this is something I will come back to, is that you look at the popularity of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party amongst African Americans. It wasn't necessarily because they're advocating the overthrow of the capital machinery. It's that they were advocating, in the U.S., a version of Communism, full civil rights for African Americans, and that was, that was the thing. That was the quest for African Americans, citizenship. Yes?

Student:  What was the readership of poems like Claude McKay's in the editorials? 

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  You know, it's always hard to gauge the readership of--of, well of anything, and--and especially in this case, and also like the Chicago Defender and the editorials that I mentioned before and that you saw in the--that you have in the documents, because a lot of these documents will be read by communities. And I mean that literally in the sense that, you know, you might have the paper coming down and ending up in a barbershop or a black public sphere--space, black public space--space where you don't know how many people are actually literate there necessarily. These things are being read out loud, they're being passed along, they're, you know, going from the barbershop, to the beauty parlor, to the dining room table. So readership, we don't--we don't really know, but when I talk about Claude McKay's If We Must Die having importance, it becomes an anthem. And in that way, in that way, I mean to imply that it was known. Whether people know all the words or not is something different, but they know about it, and they know this is a call to a new kind of mentality that they're ready to embrace as well.

I mean, something they thought was right there, when the three sixty-ninth walked--marched up to, what I should have said, to white and black applause, going up to--up, up in Harlem. These were national heroes. But on local--and when it came down to local matters, they were treated quite differently. But we'll see in next week's reading interesting terrain about--around that kind of question of who's following who. Overlapping this, and I'm getting into Monday's lecture a little bit, is the rise of Marcus--Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association. Do I talk that much about Monday or not?  I don't know. But that--that is incredibly popular during this period and that's a, sort of a X factor that's not mentioned for the sake of clarity in today's lecture. I'll clean that up a bit on Monday. Yes?

Student:  You were talking about a greater state of egalitarianism in France. 

Professor Jonathan Holloway: Yeah

Student:  And I--I understand why in the--the context of World War I that made sense, when France was so desperate, but was France a much more egalitarian society considering they'd had these brutal colonial endeavors, you know in Algiers and in the several different cities in the world?

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  But it wasn't in Paris. I mean, I mean talking--the question's about, you know, the what's the reality versus the perception--the perception versus the reality of egalitarianism in France, and thinking about France as a pretty vicious colonial state, especially in Francophone Africa. There's no doubt that there's the--the mixed reality there. You have a lot of black soldiers going over to France. And what I didn't mention, a lot of them stayed. It's like, "I'm not going back."  And you have during this period the rise of an incredibly popular movement, I mean this American musical art form, jazz, becomes incredibly popular in France, especially Paris, during that time. Jazz musicians, dancers, etcetera--and I'll be mentioning a bit of this this time next week--are in the Parisian scene and are incredible stars, and just don't want to go back, because they know they're going to be treated horribly back--back home.

There is a--a rising awareness of what's actually happening in places like Algeria during the same period, especially as some of the intellectuals start coming to Paris and interacting with African American intellectuals and artists, and interacting in very curious ways, in very complicated ways. This actually becomes more prominent as you head towards the Second World War, and the rise of anti-colonialist movements. We aren't quite sort of there yet as far as it being articulated. But there's always the difference between what's happening in the center and what's happening in the provinces, about what--what reality looks like. Anything else?  Okay, have a lovely day. Thank you.
Lecture 9 - The New Negroes [February 8, 2010]
Chapter 1. Introduction: The New Negro [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway: Okay, I'm going to get started. Let me begin with a quote by Marcus Garvey from his Declara--Declaration of Rights for the Negro Peoples of the World. One of his points reads:

"We believe in the freedom of Africa for the Negro people of the world, and by the principle of Europe for the Europeans and Asia for the Asiatics; we also demand Africa for the Africans at home and abroad."

Today I want to pick up on the theme I ended the last lecture with, and that is that black Americans, talking heading--talking about the nineteen-teens, heading into--into World War I, we're now in the wake of the challenges of that era, and the domestic disappointments of World War I, when soldiers came home and some were lynched, that black Americans were going to claim their civil rights instead of wait patiently for them. These were, as a group--and I'm generalizing here--the New Negroes. This is a term used now and again really after 1900, and one of the first proponents of the phrase was Booker T. Washington, but using it in a--in a very different way. I'm using it in a very different way than--than Washington was using it. When people talk about New Negroes, they're most often using it in a very different way than Washington intended.

Anyway, these were the New Negroes, this new--this new kind of black consciousness that really becomes articulated on a wide scale when black troops come home after World War I; the New Negro that was forged out of political and economic frustration. And it's always important to remember that this frustration grew out of more than just returning soldiers; It grew out of the race riots of 1917 and 1919; It grew out of the cultural shocks and changes that were part of the Great Migration as well. I want to show an image right now that captures some of that spirit. "The New--The New Negro crowd, making America safe for himself."  It's a play of Woodrow Wilson's, "The New Neg--the word--just drew a complete blank."

Student: "Making the world safe for democracy?"

Professor Jonathan Holloway: Thank you so much. "Making the world safe for democracy."  I don't know why, it's a--it's already a long day. [pointing to slide] Anyway, you see a--a black troop in an army jeep or some kind of vehicle, the New Negro blazoned on the side, guns coming out in all directions. He's going after German troops, giving the Hun a dose of his own medicine. But notice the banner that he's carrying: Longview, Texas, the site of a race riot; Washington DC, a site of a race riot; Chicago, Illinois, site of a race riot. "Since the government won't stop mob violence, I'll take a hand." The New Negro, in this case the black soldier, "If Wilson can't do it for black soldiers, for black citizens, if the country can't do it, blacks will take it upon themselves to do it."  This is--This editorial cartoon is yet one manifestation of a New Negro mentality. Another point--hmm--Another aspect that's important to understand about the New Negro mentality, and this phenomenon in general, was that it wasn't just about black self assertion, like this--this cartoon suggests. It was also about white reaction. The white reaction to the New--to the New Negro manifests itself in negative and positive ways. The positive ways, although fraught with complication, will be really the foundation for Wednesday's lecture.

Today we're going to hear more about the more obvious negative manifestations of white reaction to this New Negro mentality. The most--the clearest manifestation of course is the rise of the lynch mob, again the resurrection of the Klan. But from an institutional standpoint, from the standpoint of the state, the most negative manifestation of white reaction to the New Negro mentality is federal surveillance. The riots of 1917 and 1919 made white politicians nervous. Property was at stake, after all. Perhaps it goes without saying that these pol--same politicians easily ignored the real race dynamics of the riots, where white employers and property owners, black and white--well, black and white property owners, in terms of raising rents--but white employers and property owners attacked and organized attacks against black residents.
Chapter 2. J. Edgar Hoover [00:05:42]

This anxiety is deeply felt and broadly felt and becomes manifest in a very famous way with one politician in particular. The story for this person begins in 1919. The person I'm talking about is twenty-four years old, twenty-four years old, a native of Washington, D.C. Becomes the head of the Department of Justice's new organization, the General Intelligence Division, the GID. A young man. His job is to keep tabs on, and I'm quoting here, "liberal activity," whatever that's going to mean. Among other organizations being investigated, you have a wide range of black groups that are targeted for some sort of investigation. The Conservative Black Elks, who are anything but liberal, to the radical and separatist African Blood Brotherhood. The man in question is J. Edgar Hoover. His leadership of the General Intelligence--Intelligence Division, parlays himself into the directorship--directorship of the FBI when that organization was formed. And it's a position that he would hold until his death in 1972. He will have claimed that he was the most powerful person in the country. And there's a lot of merit to that kind of claim for the way that he investigates seemingly everybody.

Now why does Hoover's foundational moment matter?  It matters in part because of Hoover's world view. When race riots occur in Washington, D.C., Hoover, who is a native of the area, concluded that their cause lay in the, quote, "series of--excuse, excuse me. The numerous assaults committed by negroes against white women."  Once again, the trope appears, the fear of black male interlopers attacking or--or alluring white women. But aside from this recurring trope that demonized black males and exalted white women, why is Hoover's so--story so important?  It's important not only because Hoover would organize obsessive campaigns against Martin Luther King, Jr. and social activist groups in the 1960s--and we'll--we'll come to this later on in the course--because it--but it's also important because it's under Hoover's leadership that the federal surveillance of African Americans starts and its most intense focus of this surveillance rests upon a black nationalist Jamaican, who took up residence in Harlem in 1916. And I'm talking here about Marcus Garvey.
Chapter 3. Marcus Garvey and J. Edgar Hoover [00:08:34]

Garvey's born in Jamaica in 1887, but he is mainly educated in London. Now there's no little irony in the fact that this person who eventual--eventually fights against the spread of a white empire that oppresses black people around the world, and who organizes this fight by calling for his own black empire, there's no little irony in the fact that he himself was trained in the seat of empire. Apparently while in London, he learned his lessons well. A colonial subject, trained in the heart of the--of colonial control, who ends up advocating a new colonial presence. I mean in a nutshell, this is sort of the--the sort of fundamental irony of Marcus Garvey, and I'll be expanding upon it through the course of the lecture. Anyway, Garvey's educated for the most part in London and returns to Jamaica in 1914, and he has a plan. Having learned how to organize movements and how--how empire operated at its core, he decides in short order to organize the Universal Negro Improvement Association, the UNIA.

In formulating his plan for the UNIA, Garvey was inspired by Washington's--Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery. This book, published at the turn of the century, but its most famous section or chapter is the story of Washington's famous Atlanta Cotton Exposition address, something that Garvey, sort of from an ideological standpoint, embraced. Now Garvey's not interested in that element of Washington's plan that called for at least temporary accommodation to the white South, but he was committed ideologically, deeply so, to Washington's idea of economic self-sufficiency. If you remember back to Washington, "in all things truly social, separate as the fingers."  Garvey soon realized that his plan to emancipate blacks by economic empowerment, that his plan to emancipate blacks across the globes with the vehicle of empire formation, would not take off in Jamaica. The platform was too small. Two years after he comes back to Jamaica, he decides that if he really wanted to get at the heart and soul of blacks throughout the world, he had to move his operation to what was then popularly considered the heart of the black world, and that's New York City, more specifically, Harlem.

Now this is all a rather new phenomenon, Harlem, as far as being the sort of the center of the black world, as again popularly felt. This is a direct result of the Great Migration. And as we'll see on--on Wednesday's lecture, sort of focusing a fair amount of what's happening in Harlem for particular reasons. But for the standpoint of propagating a message, demographics and such, New York City was the place to be. Garvey's family had a background in typesetting and printing, and he gets his own training in publishing, and quickly produces a magazine or paper, called The Negro World, a journal that serves as the mouthpiece for his nationalist philosophy of racial--race pride and race unity. In short order, when he moves his operation to New York City, Negro World would have the second largest circulation of black periodicals in the country, second only to the Chicago Defender. So it's sort of out of the blue, Garvey steps into the fray and becomes incredibly popular, as does his periodical. Garvey would claim, soon, up to six million followers. Although there were never nearly that many official Garveyites, the best estimates of official followers of Garvey's movement, members of the UNIA, were around five hundred thousand. But there's no doubting the importance of the UNIA, or--or the significance of Garvey himself.

The UNIA established laundries, groceries, and other retail operations that were by and for black people, or, more accurately, UNIA members. The UNIA was about instilling race pride, and Garvey embodied it with ostentatious displays that smacked--more than smacked of--that, that represented sort of the logic of--of empire. He would organize these parades with his auxiliaries, black UNIA members dressed up in uniforms, in hierarchy, in orders, marching in parades, Garvey as the grand marshal, epaulets, gold buttons and trim, plumage, all the trappings of the benevolent--benevolent emperor. This was a performance certainly that was designed to instill race pride among sojourning blacks who were struggling with city life. Indeed, the most popular--or Garvey and his movement were the most popular amongst individuals who were fairly recently arrived--arrived to the cities. The UNIA then inspires hope for the future and also racial solidarity. You can go to a safe space, a UNIA laundry or grocery store, or just another store, buy what you need and believe that you're not getting ripped off like you were if you were going to a share--a, a planters' store, if you were a sharecropper, or if you're one generation removed from sharecropping. You could buy from the race, be treated with respect, and be part of something bigger than yourself.

Now Garvey's aware that there's a growing desire for self determination by oppressed people around the world, especially after World War I. And Garvey, aside from just having these stores and these parades, marries this desire for self determination with a call for blacks to return to Africa and to build their own country. This was not just the trappings of military and of empire in terms of just what you're dressed in, what you're wearing, but also a call to actually create that space back in Africa. Garvey first tries to get permission to establish his own colony in Africa, his target is Liberia, but he's denied permission. Upset over the rebuff, Garvey decides to form quasi militaristic groups that were designed to kick whites out of Africa. He even declared himself the provisional President of the new Empire of Africa, naming potentates to rule with him, and creating a nobility of--of anointed knights. He wanted all the sort of the trappings, the declarations, of empire. Maybe this might get him there, but to no avail.

But he does organize something that, for a moment it seems, at least for a lot of followers, seems that Garvey might be more than just about words and retail operations, and this is the Black Star Steamship Line. This is the crown jewel of Garvey's efforts, the UNIA's efforts. Garvey unfolds his plan in 1919, again, this incredibly important year, this changing notion of poss--possibility with African Americans--unfolds his plan in 1919 to build the steamship line, and he sees it as representing an effort to demonstrate black self-sufficiency and truly the potential for black nation-building. Now this is an era you need to realize that you built nations, you express international power, by navies. And Garvey's idea is eventually to build his navy and have that be the vehicle, literally and figuratively, the vehicle for his empire.

By 1920, the Black Star Steamship Line is now the focus of Garvey's Back to Africa movement. And he starts to sell bonds to raise money to purchase these ships. These ships would embody black power. They would have all black crews, for example. They would be the means for blacks to get to Africa. They would become the lynchpin of the global economy. Garvey shares this idea, this vision, this excitement, and within three months of his first call for contributions to purchase a ship, he buys his first ship. It seems to me--to be that this might actually happen, at least some change. Well, the Black Star Steamship Line quickly becomes Garvey's undoing. The steamship line ends up being three ships over the course of the steamship line's existence. Garvey drastically overpaid for each of the three ships. The first ship he probably paid eight--eight hundred percent more than he should have. The captain, as it turns out, was taking kickbacks. The second ship sprang a leak and sank shortly after the UNIA purchased it. And the third ship blew a boiler on its maiden voyage and killed a man. A comedy of errors and tragedies.

But when those ships that actually proved seaworthy for a little while, when the ships actually did make it to a port of call, traveling up and down the North American seaboard on the East Coast, thousands of black well wish--well wishers crowded the piers, stand on the hillsides, wanting to catch a glimpse of the first all black crew that they had ever seen. Certainly the Black Star Line was a complete business fiasco, there's no doubting about that, but it was a powerful symbol for black possibility. For that reason alone it would be important. But the importance doesn't end there. The Black Star Line, the business dealings that it created, remain important for the shady financing that eventually gives J. Edgar Hoover the hook that he needed to snare Garvey. We can't forget Hoover through all of this. Garvey's mass popularity his appeals for race pride, his haughty imperialist style, all of these conspire to make people like Hoover more than a little worried.

Now the fact is although that we will never know how many people were actually following Garvey, his movement did represent the first organized grassroots mass protest movement in African American history. It was the first organized grassroots mass protest movement in African American history. So if one were concerned about black autonomy, and one were already convinced that blacks, particularly black males, represented a perpetual threat, then Garvey's UNIA, Garvey himself, would have appeared terrifying. What was he going to do?  When you add the specter of Garvey, the mass movement of the UNIA, to the violence in 1917 and 1919 ripping through cities where the UNIA was at its most powerful, then you would have been convinced, if you were someone like Hoover, that something had to be done.

So Hoover took action. He decides he's going to put Garvey in jail and then sets out to find a justification for his arrest. So he knows he's going to put him in jail; he's got to find a way to do it. The first thing Hoover does is hire four black agents and assign them to infiltrate the UNIA. It's really remarkable, the Garvey Papers, it's a massive collection. Yale has it on microfilm, and you can look at the reports from these agents going back to their superiors, bits of information redacted, as we become used to in our modern world. The--some--sometimes just sort of--it's the level of silliness about going to, you know, Mrs. Johnson's last night for, you know, for her suspected UNIA involvement. She made a wonderful pie and we drank tea. I mean this is, you know, the extent of some of the reports. The rep--the infiltration did not get very far.

Hoover then tries to prove that Garvey was an agent of the British or Canadian governments, which made--which would have made him something like an unregistered foreign agent. I mean, this is rather stretching things, since the British and Canadian governments really aren't such powerful enemies of the United States, but this was still Hoover's next gambit. It doesn't work. Garvey's star is rising. We're not into the 1920s. Then Hoover finally succeeds in getting him indicted--gets him indicted on mail fraud charges. Gets Garvey thrown in jail in 1925 for five years. But before Garvey's term could be completed, he's pardoned by President Calvin Coolidge on the condition that he leaves the country, that he's deported as an undesirable alien at the moment of his release from jail. So Hoover gets mail fraud charges leveled against Garvey in twenty-three. He's in jail in twenty-five  He's out in twenty-seven, but he is sent down to Jamaica immediately.

With Garvey's deportation, federal surveillance of blacks basically disappears until the start of World War II. And it's really quite shocking that it disappears, because this is an era of real radicalism, as you'll see in the--the Manning Marable reader for this week, this week and next week. This is an era of real political radicalism, yet Hoover was so focused on Garvey and his exhortations of a Back to Africa movement and race pride that the other organizations just don't merit his attention, not nearly to the same level of attention. Once Garvey's gone, "the problem" is gone. Now what are the charges?  What of the, the--those sort of steps that got Garvey kicked out of the country?  And what about Garvey's relationship to other blacks?  I mean he was not the only black leader of this era. And, also, what shall we make of Garvey's political legacy?  The charges were literally trumped up, but they were actually basically true. Garvey was at best an inept, and at worst a dishonest, businessman. He sold bonds many times over when he shouldn't have been selling them, to raise money for his ships. He did commit mail fraud. Is it enough to deport somebody?  That's another issue.
Chapter 4. Marcus Garvey, W.E.B. Du Bois and A. Philip Randolph [00:26:32]

What about his relationship with black leaders?  Other black leaders, the most prominent ones, did not have a high opinion of Garvey. Du Bois, who offered information to Hoover to try to get Garvey in trouble. Du Bois called him, and I quote, "a little fat black man, ugly, but with intelligent eyes and a big head."  He was to Du Bois, quote, "the most dangerous enemy of the Negro race in American--Americas and the world, either a lunatic or a traitor."  A. Philip Randolph, a powerful labor leader that we'll be talking about next week, referred to Garvey--whose, whose, who is powerful at this moment in time, referred to Garvey as, quote, "the supreme negro Jamaican jackass, or a monumental monkey, who is also an unquestionable fool, an ignoramus."  Why such anger?  Jealousy, certainly part of the equation. Du Bois had been struggling for his entire adult life to build the kind of movement that Garvey shows up and builds within three or four years. Du Bois, powerful intellect, influential editor, but he cannot command the same kind of numbers and followers as Garvey could. Randolph, a rising labor leader, couldn't command the kind of following and passions that Garvey could.

So certainly jeal--jealousy, but there's also an awareness of what they saw, what Du Bois and Randolph saw, as limitations to Garvey's agenda. How was a Back to Africa movement really going to happen?  Was it even possible?  There have been Back to Africa movements for a hundred years at this point, led by black radicals, led by very conservative whites, led by progressive whites. You know, everybody, politically across the spectrum, was trying to figure out a way to get blacks out of the country. None of them worked. They logistically weren't feasible. So what's Garvey selling here?  Du Bois and Randolph says our problems, blacks' problems, are here on this soil. We need to solve them here. Du  Bois and Randolph wondered if Garvey was merely preying on the wild aspirations of those people who could least afford to invest their money in his plan. Garvey raised money from a lot of recent migrants to places like New York and Chicago, Detroit, people who didn't have much money at all to spend, not extra, not disposable income. Du Bois and Randolph believed that they, in their own separate ways, were leading the charge to care for this most vulnerable population, and that Garvey was doing something different.

And now what about Garvey's political legacy?  Was it radical or was it conservative?  Was Garvey a revolutionary, like Hoover believed, or was he merely a black capitalist?  Did he want to save Africa, or merely establish economic and political control over part of it?  I mean think of this--of his militaristic and imperialist trappings, the performance of his attire during these parades. Think of the rhetoric that I used to begin the lecture, "We demand Africa for the Africans."  To get at some of the answers to these questions--is Garvey radical, is he conservative, revolutionary or capitalist?  Do you want to save Africa for Africans or for blacks--black Americans?--to get at some of the answers, it's useful to--helpful to plumb the depths of Garvey's own publicly offered philosophies. These are all very short excerpts from the Manning Marable and Leith Mullings reader, but I want to call your attention to a few choice phrases here. On race pride and race suspicion, I guess it's a clumsy way of putting it, Garvey is dumbfounded by the white leadership of the NAACP.

"Du Bois," he said, "represents a group that hates the Negro blood in its veins and has been working subtly to build up a caste aristocracy that would socially divide the race into two groups: one the superior because of color--of color caste, and the other the inferior. Hence the pretentious work of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People."

Now there's no doubt that Du Bois--that Du Bois is an elitist. There's no doubting that. And that he believed that the Talented Tenth were the people to save the race, but getting into political bed with these white progressives Garvey thought was insane. "You cannot trust white people to do the right thing in that regard."  Du Bois hated the blood in his own--the, the quote, "Negro blood in his own veins."  On racial self preservation, Garvey was against blacks fighting for the United States in World War I. He says here,

"The first dying that is to be done by the black man in the future will be done to make himself free. And then when we are finished, if we have any charity to bestow, we may die for the white man. But as for me, I think I have stopped dying for him."

Powerful words. The kind of words you might hear out of a different revolutionary some forty years later. Similar--Similarly,

"We declare that no Negro shall engage himself in the battle for an alien race without first attaining the consent of the leader of the Negro people of the world, except in a matter of national self defense."

Blacks will not fight unless the leader of the Negro people says they should fight. That would be Garvey. And so he said that, you know, blacks should not fight for the white man, except as a matter of national defense. So when we do get our land, our plot and what is or was then and still is Liberia, sort of is his real goal, his first goal, then we fight for self defense. We don't fight for them. Speaking about racial pride, Garvey had much to say:

"We have outgrown slavery," he said, "but our minds are still enslaved to the thinking of the master race. Now take those kinks out of your mind instead of out of your hair. You are capable of--of all that is common to men of other races. We have a beautiful history and we shall create another one in the future. The faith we have is the faith that will ultimately take us back to that ancient place, that ancient position that we once occupied when Ethiopia was in her glory."

Can't trust whites, you can't fight for whites, you need to recognize the glory of our own past. And if this sounds a bit like the civilizationist rhetoric that I was talking about two weeks or so ago, you're exactly right. Garvey was a civilizationist in this way.

"No Negro," he said, "let him be American, European, West Indian or African, shall be truly respected until the race as a whole has emancipated itself through self achievement and progress from universal prejudice. The Negro will have to build his own government, industry, art, science, literature and culture before the world will stop to consider him. Until then, we are--we are but wards of a superior race and civilization and the outcasts of a standard--outcasts of a standard social system. The race needs workers at this time, not plagiarists, copyists and mere imitators, but men and women who are able to create, to originate and improve and thus make an independent racial contriba--contribution to the world and civilization."

The power is within African Americans, but they aren't expressing it. And when they do tap into those great things from their own racial past, recognize their long history of civilizationist behavior, looking back in antiquity, when they take the kinks out of their mind instead of out of their hair, then they will rise up, demonstrate their greatness to the world, be respected, have their nation, have their civilization, and as part of this, have their king. That would be Garvey.
Chapter 5. Marcus Garvey and Father Divine [00:36:22]

Now just as Garvey wasn't the only race leader operating in this sort of trying to save the race mode, you have Du Bois and you'll have--you'll learn more about A. Philip Randolph next week. There was another charismatic individual at the same time operating, another African American, who's really operating at the other end of a sort of spectrum of a sense from Marcus Garvey, but also tremendously popular. His name's Father Divine. Well that's his popular name. His birth name is George Baker, known as Father Divine, and also known by his followers as "God."  Father Divine was born, excuse me, was head of the Peace Mission Movement, that becomes very popular during this era. But where Garvey's UNIA was absolutely monoracial, it was black only, Divine's was absolutely interracial. In its very structure, black and white come together.

Now while historians are learning more about the--the women in the UNIA and the very important roles that they played, from the standpoint of the public perception of the UNIA, it's a very male ordered and dominated organization. Father Divine is a very different sort of thing, the Peace Mission Movement. He relies on his Angels to do a lot of work, black women and white women. Now there were some similarities. The most important for our purposes right now is that both UNIA and the Peace Mission Movement were profoundly self-help in their orientation. And it is in this way that Father Divine, like Garvey, was deemed a threat--a threat to authorities. He's deemed a threat because he represents to so many black autonomy. He's also deemed a threat because he consorts openly with white women in his organization, has white women involved in such prominent positions.

Now quickly here, who was Father Divine and what did he do actually?  His early history is murky. He's an itinerant preacher who extolled the virtues of what was called New Thought, the power of positive thinking regimen. That can be seen as a precursor of sorts to the New Age ideologies of the 1980s. God was in every person, according to Divine's philosophy, but he was perfectly manifested in Divine himself. Divine advocated, as I said before, interracial life, strict celibacy, communal living, and most famously, communal feasts. He was known for serving feasts every Sunday at his various peace missions that were around the country, and this was a national organization. And these feasts would run all day long with seemingly endless supplies of food, available to anybody who wanted to come by, as long as he stayed for the meal and for some proselytizing.

Divine did not represent a Back to Africa movement. He's very Victorian in his style. But he was determined to support materially, and also from the standpoint of faith, African Americans who were overwhelmingly the people he was serving, during this age of great instability and change. Garvey sees a threat in Father Divine, and he attacks Divine for preaching race suicide, celibacy and interracial relationships. You don't get more black babies if you have interracial relationships, and also if you're really preaching celibacy. The problem is, is that many of Garvey's followers also followed the Peace Mission Movement. But you can't reconcile the two from the standpoint of their ideologies. How do you make sense of it?  You make sense of it in light of the migration, the violence of the era, and the increasing poverty of the era: overcrowded cities, slum lords, black and white, charging exorbitant rents, a lack of support, despite the fact you might be getting four dollars a day, a lack of institutional and structural support for African American communities. Garvey gave hope to African Americans who were poor and struggling, new to the city. He gave them safe places to conduct commerce. Divine tapped into a sense of a--a larger belonging, of something much greater than the individual, to something metaphysical perhaps, and he fed people.

So thinking about Garvey and Divine and how to make sense of these two different ideologies--one race, interracial, Back to Africa, taking care of business here-- it sort of undergirds the sense of flux that the society's in at the moment. People are being opportunistic on the ground, trying to find a way to make ends meet, to try to find a better way of living, better quality of life. Exhausted by external threats, whether it's federal surveillance or the Klan or simple, systematic segregation, blacks were scrambling. Now it doesn't help that in addition to this federal surveillance and the rise of the Klan, Garvey actually goes to negotiate with the Klan, with Klan leadership, trying to get their support for Back to Africa politics. If you believe the reports, the leaders of the Klan and Garvey actually admired each other about at least being honest, about not liking the other person. And they can find a way to work together to get them out of each other's hair.

Divine himself courts white leaders of a very different type than Klan, the people with money who bolster the Peace Mission Movement's various holdings. They own all--they, they provide all their own food. They own all their own property. They're a cash and carry operation. A lot of it was coming from white benefactors. So you have this curious mix of high-level interactions between blacks and whites in Garvey and in the Peace Mission Movement. You have the erasure of that interaction in the--in the UNIA movement, because you couldn't trust whites, actually. You have the embracing of it in the Peace Mission Movement, interra--interracial support and cooperation. You have an extensive, a wide scope of interactions when you sort of throw the veil back from all of this stuff, between whites and blacks during this era. Despite the popularity of the UNIA, despite the racial violence, there is a great amount of exchange, politically, socially, and culturally. And this cultural exchange is where we're going to pick up matters on Wednesday. And that's when I'll see you again. Thank you very much.
Lecture 10 - The New Negroes (continued) [February 10, 2010]
Chapter 1. Countee Cullen Poem: "Heritage" [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  When I lectured on Monday about Marcus Garvey and a little bit about Father Divine, what I was trying to get at--towards the end was the complicated texture of, for the lack of a better phrase, of-- pardon me. You know, one should always remember to turn one's cell phone off, especially if you're giving the lecture. One thing I wanted to get at was the complicated texture of that moment as far as the position and ideology of these important black leaders, their competing philosophies, where their philosophies overlap, and then the maybe sometimes unpredictable ways that their followers might embrace all or parts of--of their political, ideological agenda. There is no single leader for this moment that I'm talking about for today, which is, you know, loosely called the Harlem Renaissance. Now I'll--I'll unpack that later on. But it's certainly an era and a moment filled with all kinds of conflicting and competing narratives. And one of my goals--really my main goal today is to sort of begin to add texture to the Harlem Renaissance and add some complicating narratives that I think get us closer to the truth as it was experienced on the ground.

To help us in that direction, I'm going to start with a poem. It's actually a very long poem, I'm only--and I'm only going to read a short part of it. And there's many different versions of the poem. But what I'll be--the parts I'll be reading from are really sort of the most common overlapping stanzas, as it were. It's a poem by the writer Cull--Countee Cullen. Let me just launch right into it.

"What is Africa to me:
Copper sun or scarlet sea,
Jungle star or jungle track,
Strong bronzed men, or regal black
Women from whose loins I sprang
When the birds of Eden sang?
One three centuries removed
From the scenes his fathers loved,
Spicy grove, cinnamon tree,
What is Africa to me?"

This last line here is often thought of as, you know, "what is Africa to me?" the question. It's thought of as the title of the poem. It's not the title of the poem. The title's much more complicated, as we'll see in a moment. Cullen continues in the poem: "Africa? A book one thumbs, Listlessly, till slumber comes."  He then launches into an extended exploration of the naturalism of the African scene that defined to him what Africa was. You know, you would have herds of animals, you know, flowing through the savannah, while, you know, strong, black, beautiful couples were coupling in the--in the savannah. They were in their element, a place of animals. Africa, as you see in Cullen's poem, was not a place that he had any personal knowledge of, but it's a place that is, quote, "a book one thumbs."  It's a place that you discover through someone else's words, through someone else's interpret--interpretation, through knowledge that's passed down. And in this way, Africa is a place of heritage, and that's the actual name of the poem, it's called Heritage. Continuing along in the poem, after going through these sort of naturalistic, animalistic, exotic scenes, Cullen continues,

"Quaint, outlandish heathen gods
Black men fashion out of rods,
Clay, and brittle bits of stone,
In a likeness like their own,
My conversion came high-priced;
I belong to Jesus Christ,
Preacher of humility;
Heathen gods are naught to me.
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
So I make an idle boast;
Jesus of the twice-turned cheek,
Lamb of God, although I speak
With my mouth thus, in my heart
Do I play a double part.
Ever at Thy glowing altar
Must my heart grow sick and falter,
Wishing He I served were black,
Thinking then it would not lack
Precedent of pain to guide it,
Let who would or might deride it;
Surely then this flesh would know
Yours had bone--borne a kindred woe.
Lord, I fashion dark gods, too,
Daring even to give You
Dark despairing features where,
Crowned with dark rebellious hair,
Patience wavers just so much as
Mortal grief compels, while touches
Quick and hot, of anger, rise
To smitten cheek and weary eyes.
Lord, forgive me if my need
Sometimes shapes a human creed.

All day long and all night through,
One thing only must I do:
Quench my pride and cool my blood,
Lest I perish in the flood.
Lest a hidden ember set
Timber that I thought was wet
Burning like the driest flax,
Melting like the merest wax,
Lest the grave restore its dead.
Not yet has my heart or head
In the least way realized
They and I are civilized."

And now I know I gave you like four or five stanzas really quickly here. There's--A few things that I hope that you are hearing in this reading. Cullen wrestling with the cost of conversion, religious conversion, a complicated recognition of civilization, and the very conscious evocation of race pride. Cullen writes, "My conversion came high-priced; I belong to Jesus Christ."  It's his own recognition, I think, that even when though--even though he's trained in the technique of high European arts--this is a very formalized poem after all, formalistic--the "blessing," in quotes, of training in civilization came at a high price. I mean, through this poem the, the--you see the, the, the narrator talking about this Africa he doesn't know, landing in this naturalized, exotic setting, and then wrestling with what he sees as religion, thinking, "Oh, well this is really backwards," and thinking, "Well, maybe it's actually something different. Maybe I can't actually see it because of the way I've been trained."  And that "it" he's talking about is civilization.

Cullen acknowledged--or the narrator acknowledges, as the poem goes forward, that Africans were civilized. Throughout the poem--I mean, by the end of the poem, you realize that throughout the poem he's wrestling with the question, "Well, you know, I know I'm civilized. I've been converted. I belong to Jesus Christ."  But, you know, these--these dark--these, these, these rods--these, these gods, excuse me, they're fashioning out of "dark and brittle rods," maybe there's something to that as well. And what he's really bemoaning, I think, is the fact that it took him so long to understand that these Africanist belief systems, this fashioning of many different kinds of dark gods, that he actually saw something desirable in it as well; that he often wished his god, something you can't see and can't hear in the reading of it, but you see in the print, with, you know, he's capitalizing "He" and "You" often, that he wishes his god were a god that looked black, or looked, you know, black African.

And so it's the pain of discovery that he has lost something in the process of gaining something. He wished that, quote, "He I served were black" and that if there were a black god, if one could imagine it, one could extend a belief system such that there'd be recognized--a recognition in the United States that black Americans might have some purchase--a different interpretation, certainly, but a purchase--on one of those most treasured things of being civilized, a formalized religious belief system, that a white god could be a black god and still be a god. It's a powerfully complex poem, speaks to all these different issues: verbalized pride in the natural beauty and bounty of Africa, at the same time speaking ashamedly of its simplicity; illuminating as it does that heritage is something of which one can be proud, but also something about which one can feel exquisite pain. And the speaker clearly feels, by the end of the poem, remorse about being torn in these two different directions.

Toward the end of the poem, he asks forgiveness, after all, for the actions he takes that he feels are necessitated by the strange cruelties and ironies of heritage. He says, "Lord, forgive me if my need sometimes shapes a human creed."  This last phrase, "Lord, forgive me if my need sometimes shapes a human creed," really is a metaphor that I want to use. I want to use it as a metaphor, deploy it if you will, to help us get a purchase on the New Negro Renaissance. And one quick caveat here--and I've already--in fact, I've already done it--I'll talk about the Harlem Renaissance and the New Negro--New Negro Renaissance. Just for your understanding, I'm talking about the exact same thing. This is actually old habit. For the longest time when I was being trained and educated, if--and we talked about the era, it's always about the Harlem Renaissance. In the last twenty years or so, that, well probably a little more than that, but the--the use of Harlem Renaissance has faded in many quarters, with the reference to New--to the New Negro Renaissance as well. And I--I should be detailing some of that in today's lecture. But for me, this is just--it's old habit, but with a recognition of a much more common, and I think accurate, depiction of how you'd understand this era, and that is the--as, excuse me, the New Negro Renaissance.

Whatever I'm going to call it in this lecture, I want you to think of the Renaissance as a moment where issues of culture, where politics, where economics, where social psychology, and perhaps even social pathology--not even perhaps, certainly social pathology, come crashing together. Collectively, these things, culture, politics, economics, social psychology and pathology, collectively forging a human creed out of a human need.
Chapter 2. Gwendolyn Bennett Poem: ¡°Heritage¡± [00:11:06]

In the time that remains, I'm going to canvass the Renaissance, hitting some of the famous high spots, calling your attention to some lesser known moments, and suggesting some alternative ways to think about what the Renaissance actually is.

Let's go back to Countee Cullen's "Heritage."  This is seen as one of the hallmark poems of the Renaissance. If you come across some selections of Cullen's poetry and anthologies, you'll be sure to see this poem cited. But there's another poem called, also called "Heritage" that preceded Cullen's. It was written by an artist named Gwendolyn Bennett. Renaissance historians don't really have much to say about Bennett. Much of her work, her paintings, her sculpture, her writings, much of the work was destroyed by an angry father and stepmother, who wanted her to do something "useful" with her life. But it's worth pausing for a moment to reflect on her work, and to think about the fact that what we--and, and to think about the fact that what we see here, read, about the Renaissance, has far too little to do with the women artists during the period. There were a lot of them doing important work. Anyway, "Heritage" by Gwendolyn Bennett. It's a much shorter poem but, well you'll see, you'll see why I read it.

"I want to see the slim palm-trees,
Pulling at the clouds
With little pointed fingers...

I want to see lithe Negro girls
Etched dark against the sky
While sunset lingers.

I want to hear the silent sands,
Singing to the moon
Before the Sphinx-still face...

I want to hear the chanting
Around a heathen fire
Of a strange black race.

I want to breathe the Lotus flow'r,
Sighing to the stars
With tendrils drinking at the Nile...

I want to feel the surging
Of my sad people's soul,
Hidden by a minstrel-smile."

Like Cullen--and this is--I mean Cullen's poem is quite famous; this one is sort of an afterthought. Like Cullen, Bennett has a highly romanticized notion of what one would find in Africa. Also like Cullen, Bennett has an angry coda in her poem that recognizes the painful side of heritage as well. Africa has exotic strength, natural beauty, grace, but it's also been seen as the birthplace of a people who have to hide their pain behind a "minstrel-smile." 
Chapter 3. The New Negro Renaissance [00:13:47]

So if taking these two poems together, black America's heritage presents such a quandary. What are we to make of the New Negro Renaissance?  There are at least two critical things to know about the Renaissance, at least for the purposes of this class and the examinations. It needs to be thought of as a movement, and it needs to be thought of as a movement of binaries. And I'll be getting to that in a moment. I'll be getting to--I mean, you might want to take the notes down. I'll be talking a bit about the binaries in a moment, but these are the binaries that I--that I think are worth thinking about.

Now what makes it a movement?  As I said at the beginning of the lecture, it has no singular leader like Garvey, or Du Bois, or Father Divine, or Booker T. Washington. But I think we could consider it a movement, because to understand the Renaissance, one has to understand a broad range of things that, taken together, have coherence. It's a movement involve--that involves the written word. It's a movement that involves the theater. It's a movement that involves music. It's a movement that involves the material arts, sculpture and painting. It's a movement that involves film. It's a movement that involves club life, as you see detailed in this--this very intense book I've asked you to read this week. And it's also a movement of white infatuation.

Now as I said, and I'll start--I'll start detailing these in a moment, it's also a movement of binaries, they're on the screen there. It's American and it's African. It's urban and it's rural. It embraces high culture and low, or folk culture. It's about racial independence and about patronage. So the Renaissance is this moment of astonishing cultural production going in many different directions, expressed in many different ways, but it grows out of certain real demographic changes, political changes, social, psychological changes as well. Very simply, the migration grows out of--I mean, excuse me, the Renaissance grows out of the Great Migration. You can't have the Renaissance really without the migration. Now remember, the migration was not literally from a field in Alabama to New York City--New York City's Harlem, although some certainly did make that journey in that way. The migration was moving in fits and starts, forward and back, backward and forwards, North to South again, a little further north, maybe to Midwest to North. It's a movement of, sort of a general level of chaos but tending and trending towards the North and urban centers.

That soup of the migration is rather important because if you are from the fields in Alabama and find yourself six months later--say you've been picking cotton in Alabama and now you're working in a, in a coal field--a coal mine in West Virginia and you're there for another year, it's not just about your labor, but it's about a kind of cultural exchange, your ways of looking at the world, the kind of foods you eat and the way you prepare them, the songs that are important to you. There is, with this migration, a profound cultural sharing of experiences, just by happenstance. When you move people, their ideas and their values move with them, and they clash or they mix, depending on the circumstance, in generative ways. So the Renaissance develops out of the fact that the culture is moving with the people to different places. And when you have such an intense change in places like Chicago, or Detroit, or New York City in terms of demographics, there's a heightened sense of, of, of cultural tension, and that's what's really so important about the Renaissance's connection to the migration, and why Harlem is often thought of as the, as the, as the--referred to as the Harlem Renaissance, because Harlem does become the focal point for so much of these artistic changes, although they are happening everywhere.

The Renaissance develops out of World War I injustices, and soldiers returning home, and the heightened racial awareness that grows out of it. I ended last week's lecture with Countee Cullen's, you know, "If We Must Die," often seen as, sort of, one of the, the, the, the call to arms in a sense, for the Harlem Renaissance poets, in retrospect. The Renaissance develops out of an intense black political impatience. I'll explain more about that in a moment. It's--It would be nowhere, the Renaissance, without patronage, and it wouldn't--and it wouldn't be nearly what it was if you didn't have technological developments, in terms of the publication--publishing industry and entertainment industry, literally, how you produce records, mass marketing. The Renaissance wouldn't have spread as broadly as it did without these changes as well. So there's some technical aspects to it.

Now let me try to narrow things down a little bit on the Renaissance itself. You know, it involves these different things, these different kinds of artistic expressions. It involves the different forces, you know sort of combined in a such a way to make such an important moment, but, you know, what are its boundaries?  The Renaissance--I mean the short answer is, we don't really know. We kind of generally agree, we being people who agree with me. The--But most historians really point to the Renaissance starting in 1919. There are certainly moments here and there where you, you know, have artists coming together doing some bold and interesting things prior to that. There's no doubt about it. But in terms of a self-consciousness, a collective self-conscious, a will to change, it's when the black soldiers return home. It's when the cities go up in flames and black communities are targeted, and it's given to Countee Cullen publishing this really spectacular poem--excuse me, Claude McKay, publishing "If We Must Die."  And if I said earlier--mental rewind--if I said Countee Cullen with "If We Must Die," it is Claude McKay, just to make sure I didn't misspeak.

Now that beginning, so we'll, you know, we'll stick with 1919 for this course. This is a pretty accepted start point for the Harlem Renaissance, New Negro Renaissance. Its end point is really much murkier. Many will point to the stock market crash in 1929, and there's compelling reasons, because once disposable income dries up, it's much harder to patronize a club or support an artist. So if the Renaissance continues after 1929, it's certainly diminished. But if you stop it at 1929, you would actually cut out from the Harlem Renaissance conversation a lot of its most famous artists and writers whose work really comes to be known in the 1930s. So 1929 is a bit harsh of a cut off. We can move it into the 1930s easily, with the growth of the federal government and the New Deal and the--and the support the New Deal gives to artists of all colors and backgrounds. And you might even carry it up to 1941 when the U.S. enters the Second World War. This might even be stretching it a little bit. A few people even say the Renaissance never ended; it just kind of quieted down. I think for our purposes, to have it--a useful understanding of the Renaissance, we really need to think of it as an inter-war phenomenon, 1919 to certainly the early 1930s, with less clarity maybe to 1941. The end point is less important to me.
Chapter 4. The White Patrons' Fascination with Black Cultural Performance and Ability [00:22:11]

Now within this vague realm of the timeline, there is an important marker that there's no debating: 1925 is universally recognized as a pivotal moment in the history of the Renaissance. Maybe it began with Claude McKay's poem, but a pivotal moment is the 1925 publication of a journal, a special issue of a journal called Survey Graphic. It was edited, this special issue, edited by this man, Alain Locke, a professor of philosophy at Howard University. People recognized--Locke was one of these people--that there was something happening in terms of cultural production. There were a lot of, you know, art shows, a lot of new music forms, a rise in popularity and certainly consumption. He goes, you know, "I want to tap, I want to gather up this moment, as we can do it in a journal" and so he gathers a collection of poems, excerpts from plays, essays, and short stories, that represented in Locke's mind the new spirit in black America. The special edition of Survey Graphic is published as a book. It's expanded and published as a book, edited by Locke, that is recognized as the bible of the Renaissance, and that book is called The New Negro.

Now you remember the, the phrase New Negro goes back to Booker T. Washington's, you know, popularizing of it at the turn of the century. It becomes more commonplace with this changing mentality. Soldiers come home, World War I, and really starts to go through the culture with Alain Locke's publication of the New Negro in 1926. The journal becomes--a special issue of the journal becomes an expanded book. I mentioned earlier that one of the things you need to think about the--the Renaissance is thinking of it as a movement, a movement engaging politics. Locke, a philosopher, was convinced that culture, that thing he's trying to gather up in the book New Negro? culture was a political battleground. He was explicit on these terms--this issue. The Renaissance in Locke's term, in Locke's opinion, was all about a fight for cultural recognition. And then once that recognition was gained, it was about political freedom and equality. That once black Americans could demonstrate that they have something to--something to contribute to the world from a cultural standpoint, others would have no choice but to recognize that they had something of value, and they would be embraced and given their political freedom of full equal rights.

You can hear this in the opening and closing quotes from Locke's introduction to the book, The New Negro. On the New Negro mentality, Locke says,

"For the younger generation is vibrant with a new psychology; the new spirit is awake in the masses, and under the very eyes of the professional observers is transforming what has been a perennial problem into the progressive phases of contemporary Negro life."

On the value of culture to political possibility, Locke says the following:

"It must be increasingly recognized that the Negro has already made very substantial contributions, not only in his folk-art music especially--not only in his folk-art, music especially, which has always found appreciation, but in larger, though humbler and less acknowledged ways. ... A second crop of the Negro's gifts promises still more largely. He now becomes a conscious contributor and lays aside the status of beneficiary and ward for that of a collaborator and participant in American civilization. ... The especially cultural recognition they win should in turn prove the key to that revaluation of the Negro which must precede or accompany any considerable further betterment of race relationships."

Culture is the key for Locke. So Locke really, I mean literally saw the Renaissance as a political movement, shrouded in the cloth of culture. Locke talks as some length about the folk culture that so often defined, for good or for bad, black life in America. And to be sure, this is part of the heritage that many Renaissance artists hailed in their work. But the celebration of folk art styles, rhythms, and voices becomes very complicated when we consider white infatuation, or where scholars will often use the phrase, the "white gaze."  "The white gaze."  What do we mean by the white gaze?  Talking about, literally in some ways, the people who come to Harlem clubs to witness and experience the, quote, "delirious" social scene in Harlem. White patrons coming to clubs, clubs where blacks are performing in Harlem, that blacks could not go into as patrons themselves.

Now that's a literal. He's talking about white bodies buying tickets to see black performances. But less literally, the gaze I'm talking about described white patrons' fascination, not just with black cultural performance, but cultural ability. You have prominent patrons like Albert Barnes, the famous art collector, a white man who praised blacks', quote, "authentic and native talent."  And these are very loaded words. You know, what is authentic, after all? What do you mean when you say native?  What kind of baggage is being carried with that?  Now Barnes was recognized as a great patron of the arts and as a great, as the phrase was of the time, "a friend of the race."  No one doubted, you know, his credentials in that regard. And Locke, Locke recognized this and wanted to have Barnes in his collection. He's an important figure, playing an important role in the cultural development or the propagation of African American cultural skills. So Barnes has the second essay in The New Negro. And he says the following:

"That there should have developed a distinctively Negro art in America was natural and inevitable. A primitive race, transported into an Anglo-Saxon environment and held in subjection to that fundamentally--fundamentally alien influence, was bound to undergo the soul stirring experiences which always find their expression in great art. ... The most important element to be considered is the psychological complexion of the Negro as he inherited it from his primitive ancestors and which he maintains to this day. The outstanding characteristics are his tremendous emotional endowment, his luxuriant and free imagination and a truly great power of individual expression. He has in superlative measure that fire and light which, coming from within, bathes his whole world, colors his images and impels him to expression. The Negro is a poet by birth. ... The white man in the mass cannot compete with the Negro in spiritual endowment. Many centuries of civilization have attenuated his original gifts and have made his mind dominate his spirit."

Now I know I've talked about civilization and civilizing ideologies some--you know, a lot to date in this course. But one reason I share this quote, because it is--it is the, the currency that a lot of these--these black leaders and white leaders share in terms of really who is to be saved, who is to be fought for, who has certain gifts. And Barnes, as dated as this language sounds today, and even condescending, he was being quite clear in his admiration of blacks' cultural gifts. Now he also thought that that's because they were really not quite fully civilized, but they were in touch with something more primal than whites. Whites no longer--they used to have it. They could no longer be in touch with this part of their spirit because their minds had become overdeveloped.

Now fascination with--pardon me one second here. The--the fascination from the patrons' standpoint would be complicated in the sense of Albert Barnes, an incredibly important art collector, supporter of the arts and black artistic production, but with these sort of interesting world views. You have other patrons like Charlotte Mason who, rather wealthy and supported the artists in a different way than Barnes. Barnes would buy their art; Charlotte Mason, you know, had artists on retainer, most famously Zora Neale Hurston and, at one point, Langston Hughes as well. And Zora Neale Hurston, whose most famous work comes out a little bit later in the 1930s--this is sort of the issue of stretching the Renaissance a bit. Essentially, Charlotte Mason would, you know, give Zora Neale Hurston a place--have Zora Neale Hurston stay in her apartment, and then would give her assignments. Zora Neale Hurston, training as an anthropologist, and Mason would send her down South to go and explore an area, and then come back and "tell me stories" about this native folk in, you know, the backwaters of Georgia.

Now--and Hurston would do this. I mean she didn't have any other resources, but there were times when she would push back against the patron who insisted on being called "Godmother."  She pushed back saying, you know, "I don¡¯t want to do this. I want to do something else."  And Mason said, "Well, I want you to do what I asked you to do."  So this patronage thing becomes very complicated, especially when you consider that Mason also was asking Hurston to be her housekeeper at the same time. Langston Hughes was under Mason's umbrella until he got in a fight--Langston Hughes, incredibly--sort of the poet laureate of the Renaissance--got in a huge fight with Mason and with Hurston and was sort of cut off essentially. So patronage was complicated in terms that are quite literal, in terms of "I'm no longer going to put food on the table for you," or "I'm going to kick you out of my apartment." 

Patronage could be complicated in other ways also, and this is actually a local story. It turns out that if you want to study the Harlem Renaissance, the best place in the world to do so is a few blocks away at the Beinecke. It has the largest collection of African American literature, arts, sculpture, and paintings for this period. The other great repository is down in New York City, the Schomburg Research Center, but for the Renaissance, you need to come to Yale. Carl Van Vechten, white writer, artist, photographer, and a great supporter of the arts in New York City in sort of salon culture, really connected a lot of black artists and white artists together, and a lot of black artists and white patrons together. And he convinced his friends, his black artist friends, you know, "Why don't you give your papers or your collections to Yale when it's time?"  And then he convinced a lot of his white artist friends to give their stuff to Fiske University, historically black college, when it was their time. The thinking was that black scholars would study black artists and vice versa, and they would have to go to these other institutions and sort of cross pollinate in some sort of way. I mean--and there's actually a lot of truth in what Van Vechten set up as a, as a model.

It's also rather funny the way that--that libraries, you know, have this--this coding. You all know that, you know, you'll find U.S. History in E185 point whatever. Well, in the Beinecke, a lot of their holdings are--I think Z is the beginning of, of, you know, rare books collection--ZA blank. And for the James Weldon Johnson collection, which is the umbrella for the, the works that Van Vechten got brought over to Yale, it's ZAN for "Negro."  I mean, it's just this--it's just the way things get coded. I mean this is our culture in which we live. Anyway, Carl Van Vechten was responsible for having created at Yale an amazing repository of black arts. He's also responsible for writing a very controversial book. And this is not super high quality, but a copy of its cover, Negro--Nigger Heaven, a book that a lot of other black leaders were, were horrified that he would turn on the race in a sense. But some are saying, well--it's about Harlem. It's about the Renaissance, and it's about the--it's really not--shall we say, it's a clumsy book. It's very overwrought and dramatic. It's about, you know, the mysterious beat of the tom-tom, and, you know, the, the whirling dancers and all these sort of things, highly romanticized. You can see here, you know, highly stylized African material forms as well.

Some black leaders thought this was, you know, spot on, exactly right. Others, most, were actually horrified that Van Vechten would publish a book like this, certainly with this title. So patronage coming in different forms was, was complicated, just flat out complicated. And that's partly what Scene of Harlem Cabaret you're reading for this week is getting at. Now I mentioned earlier, we need to think of the Renaissance as a movement, and one that involved white fascination, and also as a movement of binaries that combined, a movement that combined in one space seeming opposites. The most important binary in this regard is America and Africa. That Africa was being hailed and celebrated at all was revolutionary. And I don't want to dismiss this point of the Renaissance, because it's really quite important. That Africa, the lands--the land mass and its people, was being interpreted as contributing something worthwhile to civilization was a radical break. And one can see this often in the famous work by Aaron Douglas, who actually did this cover, but also produced a lot of other art from the Renaissance--that is recognized as some of the most important paintings, visual art, from the Renaissance.

And you see in Douglas an artist doing sort of the heavy lifting of bringing African cultural styles, you know, starkly angular, and bringing them into an American narr--narration, into an American scene. And we can see this really in several murals that he--it's a six-panel mural that's at the Schomburg Research Center in New York City. And there's several of--these are, you know, they're actually bigger than this, large scale paintings, that tell a story of the African diaspora to the United States and what this diaspora involves. In--and I'll show you four of these panels. In the first, you have the Negro in an African setting, an exhortation of the culturally vibrant African past, with the ring shout religious tradition being practiced and drums, dances in the state of ecstasy. And you'll see in these images I'm going to show you here [points up at slide] themes of, well-stylized forms, but also circles and light. That's what ties the images, the paintings, together.

[next slide] You have the arrival of the ships in this painting, Africans now in shackles, not knowing what their future possesses, holds for them. Ships coming to see them. You have a beam of light coming in from the distance, as you'll see, sort of forming a triangle you'll see in other images. [next slide] You see it again right away here. Now you have an ideal of the deep South. We see echoes of the African past, certainly in the body forms and shapes. We also see, right--going from right--from your right to your left, expressions of hard labor, of celebration in the circle, again, invoking the, the ring circle, playing African--instruments with African roots like the banjo, but also playing the guitar. The movement heads you from right to left, and you see in the distance, to the left, the North Star. This is that beam of light cutting through, the North Star as a path toward freedom. What you also see though, and I can't reach it. I'll use the mouse to get up there. Up here, right here, see somebody hung and a lynch rope coming down. So the ideal of the deep South is hard work, cultural celebration, tragedy, horrific tragedy, and a future elsewhere. And what was elsewhere? 

[next slide] The promised land. Shackles are broken right here. The Civil War is mentioned visually. The promised land, the land of factories in the future. You have in these images--and I've gone through very quickly, looking at my time--the binaries of, you know, African primitive--prim--primitiveness--that can't be the right word. Civilized, organized, North, freedom, industrial. The tragedies and the triumphs involved in the migration from one place to another. You also have in--and that's in the visual arts, in one sort of expressive moment--you have this binary, this wrestling with the African-ness and the American-ness in poetry as well. I mean, you've heard some of the messier versions in Countee Cullen's heritage. Langston Hughes the--again one of the most famous artists of prose in the Renaissance, writes the poem, "Negro Speaks of Rivers."  It's often hailed as sort of one of the great documents of the Renaissance.

Langston Hughes:  The poem is, The Negro Speaks of Rivers. It was written when I was 18 years old

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  No pressure.

Langston Hughes:  just out of high school. It goes like this.

I've known rivers:
I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human
veins.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

I've known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers." 

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  I don't think we need to spend much time interpreting this poem, but it is seen as, again, one of these great documents that ties together a lot of the different strands of the Renaissance. Hughes is talking about the great rivers of the world, and he's also talking about places where there were ancient civilizations. And he's connecting these great rivers with ancient civilizations that were black African civilizations. And he's saying, sort of, deep in my blood, I've known them all, I, sort of the black man, the black individual, knows them all. "My soul has grown deep like the rivers."  So there is in the Renaissance a harkening back to an ancient time and a place. Even in this poem's simplicity, we see this harkening back and this, this reaching for something of value in a civilized past. Now this reaching back to an African past, although remarkable for even the fact of celebrating anything African, was not without controversy.

A figure named George Schuyler, popular syndicated column--columnist and author who becomes--who's a gadfly sort of and becomes incredibly conservative over the next thirty or forty years. He's un--politically unpredictable at this point. He writes an essay called "The Negro Art Hokum" in The Nation, the magazine called The Nation. And he says that Negro Americans, his words, were "little more than lamp--lamp blacked Anglo-Saxons;" that the best black artists merely imitated white style, highly stylized European style, and failed to demonstrate their own. That any black art worth knowing was really--you know, a white artist would have done the same thing, but maybe with a black subject. A week later, Langston Hughes, who you just heard him reading his own poem, responds with a very famous document, "The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain."  This is in your reading of course. Seen as also another central text of the era. And he says in that piece it's the duty of the black artist to reach back, to sort of speak of rivers, if you will, and develop the culture that defined their life, be it African, rural, or southern. Blacks had to make--had to make a claim, according to Hughes, had to make a claim on their own blackness, articulated it in their own terms, and in their own ways. They were not lamp-blacked Anglo-Saxons. They were their own being.

But articulating blackness could mean different things, of course. Even if one distanced himself or herself from the highly stylized African past, something that's often seen in sort of these condescending ways, like through people like Carl Van Vechten with his, you know, mysterious tom-tom and such, where black Americans, if they're not African, well, are they southern?  What does it mean to be southern?  Are they rural?  What does it mean to be rural?  These are some of these early things I mentioned at the beginning of the lecture about what the Renaissance was. It was pulling from all these different kinds of lived experiences and imagined experiences, but never without controversy. Black leaders were angry at Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. And if you remember back a week or so, with Sterling Brown even, for writing in dialect, for using folk dialect. So many black leaders and other black artists are saying, "Look, we're not going to be respected if we start, you know, talking like 'the folk.'  We don't want to celebrate that. We want to celebrate these highly stylized forms."  So what do you get?  You get profoundly mixed messages about what is valued and what is valuable during this era.

Revealing block--excuse me, black folk dialect was counterproductive to the political project that Du Bois-- that Locke envisioned, of demonstrating black excellence. Just hang on with me a couple more minutes here. The desire to move away from the rural folk experience was also accompanied by a heightened sense of blacks as exotic. The white gaze in the US and abroad made superstars out of performers like Josephine Baker, who in the--this publicity still you see here, one of her most famous images that was marketed, famous for her banana dance. Not getting any traction in the U.S., she goes off to France and becomes a humongous star in France. But it makes you wonder at what cost, you know, at what cost did this conversion come, harking back to the beginning of the class?  What was lost when Baker develops her power and her international fame when she dons the banana skirt, often topless, as a native African woman, using the bananas in her skirt to entice a sleeping white explorer?  What's being lost in the transaction, even though something really quite amazing is being gained as well?  Is it a step forward for one, but a large step backward of the people? 

So the Renaissance is many competing narratives, as it would inevitably be with all these different people producing arts and ideas and culture. And then it begs the question, because of these competing narratives, who is the Renaissance for?  Was it for blacks, was it for whites, was it for the wealthy, was it for workers?  Was it just about art and notions of beauty?  Beauty is a complicated thing. I'm just going very quickly here. This is also the era of celebrating blackness, celebrating African forms. But it also, Madam C.J. Walker becomes the most powerful black businesswoman, a multimillionaire, by selling hair straightening products and skin lightening creams, idealizing white beauty.

I already showed you this image earlier that the Renaissance, the New Negro mentality is about a certain kind of anger and political stance. And then the last image here, in this image you start seeing the Renaissance as being larger than just the arts. It's larger than just Harlem. It's more than just words. This is a picture of Fredi Washington, one of the--one of the great performers of the Renaissance, a dancer, most famously, and an actress. And she forms--she joins a group called the Negro Artists Guild during this era. You know and it's no mistaking the fact that she has lighter skin and she has "good hair" as the phrase would have been, and actually still is in many places. But notice her armband. She's wearing a protest armband. It's of a person being lynched. That there's such resistance to, you know, anti-lynching campaigns that artists were joining these campaigns through their own artistic slash political guilds in this case.

So the Renaissance is all of these things, in small ways and, and going in these different directions, but taken together, it is a movement of an ideology that comes out of a movement of people that wrestles with the current sort of racial ideologies of the time, turns them upside down. It celebrates at the same time it dismisses and it engages in the world in terms of producing new art in new ways, but also visiting old battles in images you see like here, with Fredi Washington protesting lynching and the lack of anti-lynching laws in the United States. Thanks for hanging on a couple more minutes, and have fun in the snow.
Lecture 11 - Depression and Double V [February 15, 2010]
Chapter 1. Introduction: The Great Depression [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  For the purpose of this week, we'll essentially be resting in the 1930s, essentially. It's a week's worth of lecture dealing with the Great Depression. In October of 1929, the stock market crashes, and in a quick cascade of events, Herbert Hoover, then the President, finds himself out of office and Franklin Roosevelt is elected promising a New Deal, a New Deal for America. This week's lectures are about the Great Depression, Roosevelt's New Deal, and several critical moments and developments related to the African American experience. And I want you to--We should all start with a basic understanding of my approach to the nineteen--to the 1930s. If the twenties can be understood as the decade of the New Negro, a new sort of social and cultural and political world view, the 1930s needs to be understood as a decade of retrenchment and political advancement. We've seen this before, going into the late nineteenth century and into the turn of the twentieth century. And we're just seeing a--a new cycle of people gathering themselves up and articulating new visions and new agendas, or new, new methods to pursue on these agendas for the future.

As far as retrenchment, after so many cultural celebrations and giddiness of the jazz age, as, you know, the soldiers that have returned, the economic downturn made a different--not new really, but a different set of priorities come to the surface. The economy's in tatters and African Americans are the hardest hit. And as far as political advancement is concerned, along with the retrenchment comes a range of political responses to these setbacks that demonstrate an independence of spirit among African Americans as far as political possibilities. Now this retrenchment and political advancement, I don't want to make too much of a big deal. One can identify these themes in any particular decade or moment in time of course. But there is--there's something very special I think about the 1930s as far as these aspects are concerned.

The 1930s forms the backdrop for the modern civil rights movement, that movement that is popularly thought of as occurring from Brown v. Board's decision in 1954 up until King's assassination. As you'll come to understand very quickly, that notion, boundedness of the civil rights movement, is really sort of discarded by historians at this point. And many historians are talking about a long civil rights movement, a movement that predates the Supreme Court decision and goes back a decade or more. I'll talk more about this in a--in a week or so, this phenomenon of the long civil rights movement. But regardless of where one decides to sort of start the civil rights movement, you need to understand the thirties is clearly the seedbed, the moment where a whole new range of political strategies are going to be articulated, and these grow out of this moment of retrenchment, trying to gathers--gather oneself together in light of economic despair.
Chapter 2. The New Deal [00:03:30]

Now I want to cover the story of the 1930s. I mean for any era, there's too many different stories one could tell, but I want to explore the themes of retrenchment and political advancement in the 1930s via a number of stories. And this covers this lecture and Wednesday's lecture. I'll be talking about the Black Cabinet, the Scottsboro boys, the New Negro Alliance, the National Negro Congress, Marian Anderson and the March on Washington movement. This is a series of different--different kinds of events that really marked, marked us right through the 1930s with the March on Washington movement taking shape in 1941. Throughout this whole era, or this era--the umbrella covering this era, is the New Deal, and that's what I want to start off with very quickly, so we have just a--sort of a shared understanding of what the New Deal is doing and why it's important.

So the stock market crashes in October Twenty-Nine. The country's economically destabilized, millions are thrown out of work. Black and white unemployment skyrocketed, but blacks are particularly hard hit. Job shortages and old fashioned racism combine in such a way that a familiar--familiar rallying cry would be hear--heard at job lines and such when a black person showed up. And I'm quoting, "No jobs for niggers until every white man has a job."  A time of economic stress, good old fashioned racism makes itself known loud and clear. Even in such major cities like Atlanta, some sixty-five percent of, of employable blacks needed public assistance. This is economic devastation. Hoover believed in volunteerism and thought the economy would turn itself around without government intervention. But by the time he realized the scope of the problem, he found himself losing the presidential election. FDR's elected, promises a New Deal.

Now the New Deal's a massive federal experiment in big government. It was an alphabet soup, as, as historians refer to it, an alphabet soup of agencies, each representing different forms of federal intervention. And I'm putting a--sev--a whole bunch of them, not all of them, up on the board here, and I'm going to very quickly go through them to help you understand the scope of the change. You have the FSA, or the Farm Security Administration, and the Agricultural Adjustment--Adjustment Administration, two that are organizations that are very important to African Americans, aside from being important to all Americans, because African Americans are still predominantly--although it's shifting--still predominantly an agricultural population. They had the National Recovery Act, the NRA--that and I'll get into a little more about the NRA, it's very important, in a few minutes--that among other things establishes the minimum wage, or establishes minimum wages is the better way to put it. And there's a very curious relationship with African American--African Americans and the jobs that they hold.

The Tennessee Valley Authority and the Rural--Rural Electric--Electrification Administration, these are up here really to point out what kind of radical change the New Deal is really all about. This is an era when they're actually bringing electricity for the first time to large parts of the country through, through the TVA and hydroelectricity and rural electrification. It's a radical reordering of how the country's going to work. National Youth Administration, NYA, which as we'll see, I'll talk briefly about it later on, is one of these many administrations that has a Negro division, and the Negro division becomes important. I mean I'll, I'll--You can bookmark it for the moment. Civilian Conservation Corps, the CCC, literally putting mostly men to work by digging ditches, planting trees, giving them some sort of job to do so they can get some wage from the federal government, so they can feed themselves. Public Works Administration, the Works Progress Administration, the PWA turns into the WPA, doing work on public projects. Social Security is established, the Securities and Exchange Commission is established, the FDIC, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. All of these are brand new during this era.

So what we consider the essential work of the federal government is, in our contemporary moment is essentially created during the New Deal. All is a radical attempt to end the Great Depression. And we have been wrestling, we, political leaders, activists, have been wrestling with the legacy of the New Deal ever since. Now the point of listing all of these agencies up here is not just that many of these had a direct effect on African American employment and, as you'll see, political possibility, but it also will bring into--I'm sort of for--projecting here a bit--it will underscore changes--how can I¡­not changes--articulations, new articulations of changes in terms of the limits of the federal government. We'll see during our lecture of the civil rights movement, there's a core issue and that's the fed--limits of federal government versus states' government. With the explosion in the size of the federal government, you can see this problem looming ever larger on the horizon.

Now very basic questions, was the New Deal successful?  It's all an experiment. And economically, the answer is mixed. Yes, there is no doubt, it saved millions from starvation, I mean, literally saving folks from starving to death. But the economy doesn't actually turn around until the U.S. begins arming Europe as it heads toward Second World War. When the U.S. becomes a military factory and then itself becomes involved in the Second World War, that's when the economy turns--absolutely booms and it turns around at that point. So economically it saves people from starving but it doesn't turn the economy around. Politically, it's much more complicated. From an institutional standpoint, there's no doubt that the New Deal's significant. Whether it's successful I guess might be an interesting word to wrest with here because, as I said before, it makes the modern American political state. It does it in the space of just a few years.

Now from the standpoint of the African American experience, was the New Deal successful in terms of politics here?  There's a real mixed record. On the ground, too many federal programs were left to local administrators to run. So you have--and this is where something like the Farm Security Administration, Agricultural Administration--Adjustment Administration, are really important. Federal policy is saying you're not going to discriminate. Everybody's going to get a sh--a cut of this New Deal. But the bailouts are handed out at the local level, at the local Farm Bureau, let's say, and localized racial practices simply just don't disappear. So you have growing out of the New Deal, or during the New Deal, American farms being saved, but the farms that are being saved overwhelmingly are those that are white-owned and not black-owned. So when you think of the New Deal from the standpoint of did it benefit African Americans, you can look at federal--at, at the sort of national policy and see something, non-discrimination pacts, but local level's where it really matters, you see a very different story there.

Now just as some of these--many of these New Deal programs were doing something important by being non-discriminatory in their language, and then therefore at the local level being more complicated, they weren't all perfect at the federal level of articulation. And this is where the NRA, the National Recovery Administration, really needs to be understood. As I said before, the NRA designed a set of minimum wages, basically wage standards, across the country. So, for instance, if you are rolling steel, you're going to get paid a certain minimum wage. If you are--boy, of the billion and a half jobs, I can't think of anything right now. If you're--[laughs] God, pick a job--you are doing some other mechanized thing, how's that for a complete bailout?  You're going to get paid a certain set wage. Now the reason I was flailing here, because there are certain areas the NRA doesn't address the minimum wage, and I kept wanting to say those things; That's why I was fumbling. It does not establish minimum wages for people in agricultural sector. It does not set minimum wages for people doing domestic work. Guess what African Americans are mostly employed in: agricultural work and domestic work.

Now there are all kinds of reasons that people who conceived the NRA had for not putting floors at, at certain wages for certain industries, agriculture and domestic work in this case. They weren't explicitly about, "Oh, let's stick it to these people."  But the fact was, the effect was, they were sticking it to these people, to farmers in general and to people doing domestic work. The NRA then becomes a symbol for how little the New Deal was doing for black America. Long term effects, there's no doubt, very important, and we'll see that in the next couple of weeks, from the concept of what the federal government is. From an institutional standpoint, there's no doubt, it's important, it's critical, it's saving lives. When it comes to black life on the ground, a mixed bag. When it comes to NRA, which had really more power than any other of these administrations to change the quality of black life, to sort of bolster it up, no dice. So African Americans start calling the National Recovery Administration, the letters NRA, referred to as Negro Rights Abused, Negro Rights Assassinated, Negro Removal Act, Negroes Ruined Again.
Chapter 3. The Black Cabinet [00:14:38]

Now we're talking bread and butter issues here. But politics of course exist at the symbolic level, and when it comes to African Americans, there is no doubt that symbolically, the New Deal was an overwhelming success. The political symbolism of the New Deal for blacks came mostly through the establishment of a group called the Federal Council on Negro Affairs, the Black Cabinet. They're the same thing. The Black Cabinet was an unofficial--it's important to understand that part--an unofficial collection of race advisors, and that was their title, who stood in various places in Roosevelt's administration. This was the first broad-based group of federally appointed bureaucrats and administrators who were African American, at the federal government--in the federal government's history. Prior to this moment, you might have Frederick Douglass appointed to federal position, Booker T. Washington being consulted by the President about certain kinds of ideas and policies. But in the New Deal, you're actually getting a, a cadre of African Americans with federal appointments, working within the administration on a full-time basis.

The members of the Black Cabinet were all highly-educated and all male, with the lone exception of Mary McLeod Bethune, who was the one, well, one female. Seems my, there we go. Mary McLeod Bethune. And the spelling is correct and the pronunciation's correct, it's "McCloud."  Mary McLeod Bethune, the sole female in the Black Cabinet, who also happened to be regarded as the cabinet's leader. Now the Cabinet, the Black Cabinet, leaves no discernible policy record or legacy. Their job, the job, the things they did were mainly accomplished behind the scenes. And, in fact, I, I know this, this--I planned to write my dissertation on the Black Cabinet, only to discover, once I got here, there was no record. So, new dissertation topic.

Their job was mainly conducted behind the scenes, so you'd have a Secretary of the Interior, or a Secretary of Agriculture, wanting to, you know, find out what's going on with black America. They have a race advisor, and they would assign him--overwhelmingly him, of course, except for Mary McLeod Bethune--the task of finding out, or being the, the touchstone to, to understand what's happening in black America. And there might be an issue bubbling up, say in the National Parks or some other place, that the race advisor might know about, and would put sort of a bug in his boss's ear, and it might gently change administration policy, or maybe even law that way. But we don't actually know the literal changes they made. But we do know that they were very important symbolically. And the most important person symbolically in this regard is Mary McLeod Bethune.

Bethune, who's the head of the Negro Youth Division of the National Youth Administration, an educator, lifelong educator, and then, most importantly, a close friend of the first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. Bethune is seen, seen to be the voice of black America in so many ways, in this, in this, in the, the Black Cabinet, that is, because she had access. And there was--it was op--it was not a secret. It was well known that if you wanted to talk to Franklin Roosevelt and you're African American, you had to go through Eleanor Roosevelt, and if you wanted to talk to Eleanor Roosevelt, you had to go through Mary McLeod Bethune to get access. So the Black Cabinet needs to be understood as the first political insiders in black America, and I'm talking high politics here. This is an era where the Black Cabinet officers would be trotted out. Pictures of them, or sometimes themselves literally, trotted out, sent on sort of as part of a delegation to a particular area of town, the country, representing the federal government to a black enclave. And they were seen as embodying the fact that Roosevelt cared. Whether you're talking Mary McLeod Bethune or somebody else, Roosevelt cared because he had people appointed to express or deal with, address their concerns. This is how they're symbolically so important, and it's also important to know that over the course of the 1930s, during FDR's presidency, through the interventions of the New Deal, sometimes literally, most often symbolically, African Americans turn from a Republican voting population to a Democrat--Democratic voting population. A complete shift by the time you get to the late 1930s. The Black Cabinet's important in that process. 
Chapter 4. The Scottsboro Boys [00:20:25]

Now just as you're seeing the establishment of the first sort of professional administrators, bureaucrats, African American, in the federal government, certainly at high level, there is--this is also an era of incredible political setback and disappointment. So you see the great political possibility of the Black Cabinet, but you also see events happening in the early 1930s that horrify black America. The most famous of these cases was the Scottsboro boys scandal. On March 25th, 1931, a white boy comes off of a train, passing through Tennessee and the northern tips of Alabama. He comes off the train with a bloody head and claims that there was a big fight between black and white boys on his freight train that just passed through town. A posse forms. The train is stopped at the next station. The posse looks for and arrests the nine black boys who happen to be on the freight train. Now what the posse had not expected--and that would have been the end of the story, if that was all that had happened. What the posse had not expected to find were two white women, Ruby Bates and Victoria Price. And they were found in the same freight car as some of the black boys.

As soon as Ruby Bates and Victoria Price are brought out, they see all of the police and the posse around them, and they're with these black boys, they immediately size up the situation and declare they've been raped. This changes everything. The nine boys are accused of rape, become known as the Scottsboro boys. That's where the, the court cases were being held, in Scottsboro, Alabama. They range in age from twenty to thirteen. There were one or two brother pairs, but they didn't know each other, essentially. They all happened to be there. But word of the rape spreads like wildfire, and the next day, a mob of two thousand people forms at the jail where they'd been kept, urging the release of the boys so that, quote, "southern justice" could be handed out. The National Guard is called in immediately to keep them safe, which is remarkable in and of itself. The media does not help matters when it, when it comes to this particular case and the fact that, you know, the word of this vicious attack starts to spread. As they start the process of sending the boys to trial, the media, several quotes from different newspapers:

"How much farther apart than night and day are the nine men who perpetrated these frightful deeds and a normal, kind hearted man who guards his little family and toils through the day?"

Okay, not too offensive.

"We still have savages abroad in the land, it seems. Let us have the solace of knowing that at least we have risen above this justice of savages."

A reference to the fact that, that the mob that wanted to kill the Scottsboro boys did not succeed. So with an editorial, giving a collective pat on the back to folks who did not resort to the same kind of savagery those boys did. But then you'd have editorials like this:

"The rape was the most atrocious ever recorded in this part of the country, a wholesale debauching of society, so horrible in its details that all of the facts can never be printed. It savors of the jungle and the meanest African corruption."

This is pre-trial media. Not very helpful for a defense case. At seven AM on the day of the first trial, thousands are lined up, trying to get a seat inside. And you--it's hard--you can't really tell from this image, [gestures up at the screen] but as the, the group goes this way, you can see it where the electric lines are cutting across, the line goes beyond the screen, beyond the, the actual image. Thousands are lined up hoping to get into the courthouse to see justice be enacted. Well, the boys had no money, they're dirt poor. They have a defense attorney assigned to them who's completely incompetent. They face an all-white jury. This is Alabama practice. No blacks are allowed in the jury rolls. And, within two weeks, the boys are indicted, tried, and all but one are sentenced to death. The nature of the defense, the speed of the trial, the fact that it was not a jury of their peers, angered African Americans and other parties. One party got--was moved to act very quickly, and that's a group called the International Labor Defense, the ILD. The ILD is the legal arm of the Communist Party, and the ILD comes to the Scottsboro boys'--boys' rescue immediately, claiming they were given an inadequate defense, and all these different things already cited. "This was not justice; you need to have a retrial." 

Now the Communist Party in the USA has been around since 1919 or so. It's been reaching out in sort of tentative ways to African Americans, with, with, you know, middling success really, increasing but middling. The NAACP's been around a solid decade longer, so one would presume they're right there rushing to defend them. Well, the fact is, no. The NAACP holds back. It holds back for a very important reason. It did not want to tar its own image by defending possible rapists and individuals who clearly did not adhere to the NAACP's middle class ideals. This is really important to think about--to understand about the NAACP. It was from its very founding a middle class organization, dedicated to uplift in legalistic and political ways, assimilationist in its ideology, assimilating to white norms, white--so-called white middle class norms. The Scottsboro boys did not fit that model, and the NAACP was afraid of defending them for fear of a negative association.

The Communist Party sees this as an, an incredible opportunity, as a way to organize African Americans to become more sympathetic to the Communist Party. The Communist Party claimed that defending the Scottsboro boys was tantamount to fighting Southern racism and economic repression. So the Communists did not have super success with African Americans, because they were saying it's all just about economics. And African Americans are saying, "Well, race kind of matters too in this country."  The Scottsboro boys was the, was the window of opportunity for the Communist Party to broaden the scope of what it's going to talk about as it relates to the African American experience. This transpires and the NAACP's livid. It wants to be the organization really dedicated to addressing black concerns, and it's very concerned that the Communist Party is involved, because the radicalism of the Communist Party was, was the, was about the last thing that's going to be welcomed in a politically and socially conservative south.

So the NAACP doesn't want to get involved because it--it would be tarnished by these boys' activities, but they also recognized that with the Communist Party getting involved, it might be a death, a death sentence for these boys, because no one wants to hear from the Communists. And certainly as the Communists saw this as a way to open up a discussion about Southern racism, NAACP thought that, you know, "You're, you're pulling too many things together here, and trying to--basically you're trying to develop racial insubordination in the South. This is not the way to go."  The Scottsboro boys' case because--becomes the cause c¨¦l¨¨bre of the 1930s. All of the issues we've talked about in this course so far are wrapped up in this history: manliness, civilization, culture, race, class, power, politics, and protest, they're all here. The NAACP wanted more than anything else for a fair trial, and began to think, "Well, maybe we should get involved, because we might be able to win long-term advantage for African Americans by changing the way that trials are organized in the South," since there were no blacks on the jury rolls; that might help further legal challenges and other movement opportunities down the--down the road.

And the NAACP, you know on a quick side story, it knows the South very well, far better than the Communists did, who were mostly northern and urban at this point. And they reach out, the NAACP reaches out quietly to try to find lawyers for the Scottsboro boys who are competent. And they talked to George--Congressman George Huddleston, someone Alabamans considered a fiery left winger. But being liberal on white issues in the South did not necessarily translate into being a liberal on, quote, "black issues" here. Huddleston's response to the quiet overture from the NAACP to support the Scottsboro boys' defense, and I quote here,

"I do not care whether they are innocent or guilty. You can't understand how we Southern gentlemen feel about this--this question of relationship between Negro men and white women."

Simply put, the fact that the boys were on the freight--the same train as the two white girls was enough for Huddleston. He couldn't touch it; it's toxic. So the very basic chronology of the case is as follows. In 1931, the boys were arrested and convicted. In 1932, the Supreme Court overturns their convictions, saying the boys lacked adequate counsel. The fact that they're still alive is really nothing short of a miracle, to be honest, and this is through the ILD's efforts. In 1930--in February 1933, Ruby Bates, one of the two women who was found on the, the train, writes a letter declaring that the boys never touched her, that's it's all made up to protect their honor. A month later, a new trial begins and Samuel Leibowitz, an ILD attorney from New York, offers new evidence, but is considered to have been too tough on Victoria Price, the, the hold out. And to her, to her death, she claimed that this was--that she had been raped. Samuel Leibowitz presents new evidence, but was considered too tough on Victoria Price, thus violating Southern codes of honor. After one day of deliberation, Haywood Patterson, one of the Scottsboro boys, is found guilty. The prosecutor is saying openly, "Show them that Alabama justice cannot be bought and sold with Jew money from New York."  This is the atmosphere of this case.

NAACP blames the I--the Communist Party and the ILD for this conviction and that--and at that point realizes, or decides, they have to get involved if they're gonna--if there's going to be any hope of saving the rest of the boys. By 1935, the ILD and NAACP are formed together in a coalition to defend the boys. The Communist Party's actions through all of this gave it a new base of intellectual and political support, within Harlem certainly, and black America in general. The Scottsboro boys' mothers go on a world tour, supported by the Communist Party, to rally support for their sons, but also for workers' plights, for workers' plights around the world. And this is really--this point is important. The Communist Party makes major inroads in Harlem in particular, and you can see here in this image, this is a Scottsboro boys rally. And above my hand here there's a big sign, a big poster, and the words you can make out there is talking about workers, and below it, Scottsboro boys. The Scottsboro boys themselves were, were vagabonds, hobos riding the rails, not uncommon during this period in time.

The Communist Party gets involved and as a way to sort of justify its involvement certainly, but also to rally other people around the cause of the Scottsboro boys, starts talking about them as, as workers. "This is what happens to workers in the United States under a capitalist system."  The Scottsboro boys' mothers are sent on these international world tours and they're coached about how they're going to talk about the worker's plight, that the Communist Party cares about the workers of the world, and at the end, it's a demonstration--it's, it's proven by the way that they're advocating on behalf of their boys. As we start to learn more about the Scottsboro boys' mothers' tour, their world tours, we're discovering the extent to which they were--manipulated is too strong a word--but how they were so highly scripted, the mothers that is, in terms of what they were supposed to say and not say and how they were being sort of handled at all times to make sure they stayed on message.

Now, be that as it may, whether there was a level of manipulation here or not, the fact is the Communist Party is making incredible efforts on behalf of the Scottsboro boys, and the case is followed everywhere. And this actually--This is actually another image from Harlem. And this--I'm sorry you can't really make it out here, but in a sense, this is a, a, a version now of what you'd see--what do they call those things in Time Square, those scrolling messages?  This is an update on the trial, when Patterson is found guilty. And there's a commentary written down in chalk on this blackboard. People are gathered around it to find out what's happening with the Scottsboro boys. Now what happens to them?  They get arrested in thirty-one, a new case in, in thirty-two. New cases in thirty-three, in thirty-three, a coalition in thirty-five. More hearings were held. Half the boys are released within a few years of the original incident. The other half languish behind bars, and the last one, the last Scottsboro boy is released, no longer a boy, in 1950.

The Scottsboro boys' cause became the focal point of rallies across the country, in Harlem, as these images show, black college campuses. The Scottsboro boys' cause became the sites of numerous political protests, and it really speaks to the new era or new philosophy about black politics during this era. These rallies are not the rallies of Garvey's Back to Africa dreams. They're not the silent protest marches, protesting against lynchings. The Scottsboro boys' rallies, although they are rich in symbolism about the black--the black boys being workers, they also start to change political affiliations and movements on the ground. The Scottsboro boys' rallies are, in so many ways, explicitly political. And these rallies, in this way, are new to the, to the scene as far--far as black Americans were concerned. And we'll see how this is articulated in movement politics in--in our next lecture.

So taking together the Black Cabinet and the Scottsboro boys' case, represent two sides of new political possibilities and new forms of political expression within black America: high politics and, for lack of a better phrase, the low politics, but also becoming topics of international conversation in terms of the black political situation. It's a time of change. Oh one image here I forgot, before I tell a quick story. This is a poster. I mean the Scottsboro boys went on tour. In 1937, Willie Robinson and Eugene Williams came to New Haven to tell of the "horrors of hell and the pleasures of heaven."  They came to the Emanuel Baptist Church to talk about their experiences in, in, Scotts--in the, in this case. It's a local story in this way, but it's part of a larger international phenomenon.
Chapter 5. The New Negro Alliance [00:38:07]

Now I want to switch gears quickly from the Black Cabinet and the Scottsboro boys to talk of the New Negro Alliance. And I've got six minutes to tell what I used to do in a lecture, so hang on. The New Negro Alliance is a local articulation--this is local being Washington D.C.--of a larger national phenomenon, "Don't buy where you can't work" campaigns. "Don't buy where you can't work" campaigns. And it speaks to this new sort of form of political organizing that I'm suggesting is there with the Scottsboro boys and the, the Black Cabinet. So I've seen certain ways the New Negro Alliance pulling together embodying this new political philosophy. That's why I want to tell this story very quickly. So there are these campaigns across the country where black--blacks would organize and say, "We're not going to buy at the local thrift store, because they won't employ black workers in this black neighborhood.

In August of 1933, this philosophy, this political movement, lands in D.C. where the owner of the local hamburger stand in black Washington, in, in the area, U Street district near Howard--Howard University, sort of the major black shopping enclave in the city. When the the guy who owns the hamburger grill fires the two black workers he has and hires two white kids in his place, wants to give them jobs. You know, everybody's desperate for jobs since it's the Great Depression. Within hours, a picket line's formed at the hamburger stand, in the spirit of "Don't buy where you can't work."  "We're not going to patronize the store anymore, because they won't let our type, our folks, black folks, work in this place."  And this is a white owned store, if that part wasn't clear. It should have been. Next thing you know, an--a group is organized. Two or three young men in college, just heading out of college, called the New Negro Alliance. One of these "Don't buy where you can't work" campaigns, and the city becomes electrified, black Wash--Washington that is, as New Negro--New Negro Alliance starts holding rallies, putting up posters. This is about staying out of People's drugstores. You know, "They won't employ blacks in the store, we're not going to shop there any longer."  To all fine--to all fair-minded people, justice is, is essential to Americanism. People's is not just being racist; they're being anti American.

Other pair--posters would go up, fliers, again, about People's Drugstore. "Don't cheat on your race. Stay out of all People's Drugstores."  And so equating People's Drugstores to an overseer whipping a poor black laborer. Now this is sort of the angry political art of a, you know, college age students. You know how you guys are. But the New Negro Alliance really became remarkable for the way that it brought in all these different sectors of, of black Washington. The most respectable members of Washington start joining picket lines. "People's is unfair, no colored clerks in colored neighborhoods. Stay out."  In short order, the New Negro Alliance starts getting success after success. The local dairy, People's Drugstore, the cigar shop, all these places start to hire black workers, but there's a hold out. The hold out is the Sanitary Grocery Company.

The Sanitary Grocery Company is the most important grocer in Washington D.C. during the era. It's in black neighborhoods and white neighborhoods. Sanitary Grocery employed black workers, but as back office workers, stockroom boys, or janitors. These were the lowest paying jobs in the store and they were also the invisible jobs. New Negro Alliance comes up to them and says, you know, "The best paying jobs in your store, aside from being managers, are the cash register clerks. Why don't you have any blacks in those positions?"  Sanitary Grocery gave its explanation, gave its reasons, and the New Negro Alliance puts up picket lines like this one. This is just one person, but starts putting up picket lines around Sanitary Grocery. Sanitary Grocery is not going to fold like these other places fold, and so starts its own political campaign with photographs of all the black workers, you know, dressed in nice uniforms, smiling for the camera. You know, "Sanitary Grocery works--you know, we work for Sanitary Grocery, support Sanitary Grocery."  So they're trading fliers, pamphlets, media bout--you know media shots for a--for a long time. It starts becoming a legal case.

The New Negro Alliance activists reach out to Howard University Law School. This is a pre--pro--prologue to the lecture next week. They reach out to Howard University Law School, and says to the law school students, "We need help organizing a court case here."  And they start getting legal counsel from some of the law students and some of the law professors. Because it's in D.C., a court case can become a Supreme Court case very quickly. The le--the issue--the legal issue, Sanitary Grocery Company is saying, "You cannot picket in front of our store. You're not an employee."  Just like this minister is picketing in front of People's. He didn't work at People's. Sanitary Grocery is go--Sanitary Grocery is saying, "If you don't--if you aren't an employee of the company, you aren't allowed to picket."  New Negro Alliance said, "This is a free speech issue. We can picket."  And it becomes a Supreme Court case.

And in 1938, aided by the attorneys at--the attorneys in training and the, the faculty at the law school at Howard, the Supreme Court offers a decision in The New Negro Alliance versus Sanitary Grocery Company. And in that decision, it says that it's protected speech, picketing that is. As long as you're not interfering with the business at hand in terms of blocking the entrance, let's say, it's protected speech. And as such, these rallies, these--the work of the New Negro Alliance, is perfectly constitutional. It's a major boost to the labor movement, as it happens, and it really makes great changes for the New Negro Alliance. It further, you know, underscores its importance. It also tells a really interesting story at the end. There's a coda that I think is really humorous, but tells you something about the way these things operate.

Sanitary Grocery Company was the most important grocer in the city, and the last thing it wanted or needed was to be affiliated with a Supreme Court case that it lost, especially losing to African Americans. So the Sanitary Grocery Company ceases doing business under that name, and it becomes Safeway.

For those of you who know about Safeway, yes. I mean Safeways are actually disappearing now, because they're being bought up by other conglomerates, but Safeway's a major change--well, last I knew, still a major chain in--in California. And they're still in the D.C. area, although they are slowly going away, being bought up by, last time I checked, which is a couple of years ago, it was--it was owned by the parent company of--that also owned Vond's, Pavilion's, Dominic's, Carr's, Randall's, Tom Thumb's, Grocery Works. I think it's a big Canadian conglomerate. But this is, I mean it's a humorous coda for those who know Safeway. There's no mention anywhere of Safeway's history, corporate history, of this actual--actually happening. Corporations don't want to be tainted with, well, lack of success or really bad news. And in the case of the "Don't buy where you can't work" campaign in Washington D.C., they had both. And so Sanitary Grocery Company ceased to exist. It started operating under a new name. This is the potential of the new black politics: high politics, low politics, somewhere in the middle politics, and you're going to start seeing in tomorrow's lecture and in the, in the lectures over the next couple of weeks, a new kind of organizing mentality, operating at all levels, that starts to change the landscape of the American scene. Thanks so much.
Lecture 12 - Depression and Double V (continued) [February 17, 2010]
Chapter 1. The National Negro Congress [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  In the last lecture I set the terms for the week's discussion, those being retrenchment and political advancement. I wanted to make clear on Monday's lecture that the Scottsboro boys and the Black Cabinet represent two ends of a spectrum of political possibilities of black America in the 1930s. They are together articulating a new voice, a new vehicle to communicate responses to and articulations of possibilities, but coming from very different places in very different ways. The Scottsboro boys reaches back to a past of social control, certainly, but also representing in the Scottsboro boys case, in the way the Communist Party gets involved, that there's a new mentality at work in black America, and new values in--or being seen--the, the, the accused being seen as commodities on a political battlefield. And the Black Cabinet represented the best possible world of new political insiderism at the national level, in a different way than the Scottsboro boys, serving as important symbols of blacks' centrality to the political realm.

Now I wanted to continue the discussion along those lines and to--these--I¡¯m sorry--these are the themes for this week. I want to continue the discussion along these lines, but focusing upon the National Negro Congress, the Marian Anderson Easter Sunday Concert, and the March on Washington movement. This--the events for this lecture are essentially the second half of the 1930s. But it's important to realize, the things I was talking about in Monday's lecture are overlapping, many of the events I'm talking about today. These are all happening in the course of the decade, but certainly at some point all happening at the same time.

Let me start with the National Negro Congress. The National Negro Congress--for some reason, this is a lecture I wrote down a lot of notes for you guys, and I'm not sure really why. Maybe I was being generous. I don't know. Anyway, the National Negro Congress has its start in the National Industrial League. It forms in 1933. This is a response to the development of, well, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and agencies like the National Recovery--well, an early incarnation, the National Industrial Recovery Act, and how this organization was not going to care about setting wage, setting minimum wages for agricultural workers or for domestic workers. And two men get together, Robert C. Weaver and John P. Davis, and start--black men, and start testifying before Congress, before the Senate, saying, you know, "This is an abomination. You're completely wri--writing out or, or disregarding those areas that have the most important or significant black involvement."  The Negro Industrial League is a two man operation, but they fashion themselves as an umbrella group representing black interests across the country. It--It exists pretty much only in passing. Now the important part of it is that Robert C. Weaver is seen as doing such a great job, having recent--recently received his JD from Harvard, he gets incorporated into the federal government, and is one of the very first race advisors. So that's where the Nation--the Negro Industrial League is important for bringing in one of its own into the federal bureaucracy. The other person, John P. Davis, remains an outsider, and we'll be spending more time on Davis's activities in the course of this lecture.

Davis organizes, in the wake of the Negro Industrial League's collapse, the Joint Committee for National Recovery. It lasts only for two years. It too fashions itself as an umbrella organization representing blacks' needs from across the country. Now this is a self representation. I mean these were not, you do not--You do not have all sorts of black run organizations, running to John P. Davis and the Joint Committee for National Recovery, which is essentially him and an office and a couple of figurehead people. Davis--well they aren't running to Davis, because one, this is a new kid on the block basically. They're still looking at organizations like, you know, churches, business associations, the NAACP, for example, but the Joint Committee for National Recovery does at least one important thing before it collapses, and it organizes a conference at Howard University. And this is a conference that is dedicated to trying to understand the economic plight of African Americans during the Great Depression and the New Deal.

Now it's just a conference, but it brings--but it's remarkable that it brings together people from a wide range of political backgrounds. It brings together labor organizers, agricultural workers, domestic workers, you know, people who are doing work on the ground. It brings together intellectuals like W. E. B. Du Bois, who's becoming a Marxist and talking economic cooperatives along race lines, something actually in some ways looking similar to Booker T. Washington's ideologies. It brings together leaders of the Communist Party, the Workers' Party, the Socialist Party. It brings together people from the federal government, like Robert C. Weaver now, all asking the question: what is the status of the Negro in, in the New Deal?  And the result of this conference was--well, many things came out of it. One, scathing attack on the New Deal for the way it ignored blacks' conditions on the ground, in ways I outlined briefly on Monday. It launched an investigation into communist activities at Howard University, Howard University then essentially being funded by the federal government, and essentially now still receiving most of its support from the federal government. An investigation was launched into the communist activities at Howard, and certainly there were communists on the faculty at Howard and certainly socialists as well, and certainly a lot of sympathizers. So there was an attempt to silence and actually shut down the university as a result of this conference. And most importantly, it establishes a group called the National Negro Congress. I forgot that slide. Okay, those are the notes for what I just told you.

The National Negro Congress actually does turn into that kind of umbrella organization that the Negro Industrial League and the Joint Committee for National Recovery all aspired to be. The National Negro Congress forms out of a call, I mean the Howard University Conference, "We need to organize a, a national political action group," and it becomes the National Negro Congress, formed in 1936. The congress convenes for the first time in Chicago in thirty-six, where it's met where--with police harassment, due to alleged communistic, communist participation. A. Philip Randolph, who we'll be talking about more towards the end of the lecture, but for now, just to know the most important--Bless you.

The most important labor leader in black America, is elected its first president. And the National Negro Congress establishes--sorry I'm all off on my slides here today. Excuse me. It establishes a slate that's concerning civil rights, women's rights, labor's rights, aid to farmers and sharecroppers. It calls for an anti-lynching law; it calls for voting rights, educational opportunities, social and unemployment insurance, and opposition to war and fascism. Civil rights, women's rights, labor's rights, aid to farmers and sharecroppers, anti-lynching law, voting rights, education opportunities, social un--and unemployment insurance and an oppression to war and fascism. If you think back to a few weeks earlier in the course, a large part of this slate that the National Negro Congress calls for is identical to the slate, to the manifesto, that the Niagara Movement calls for some thirty years earlier, not quite thirty years. The point is, a lot of the issues haven't changed, despite some real changes in those thirty, thirty-one years, excuse me.

Now the National Negro Congress was not just made up of black folks getting together calling for a slate of a progressive future. It is, as the slide up here indicates, a cross section of black groups and white labor, of all different kinds of groups as far as black business bureaus, black churches, black labor organizations. The congress actively courts white labor in this regard, especially the Congress of Industrial Organization, and it sets out this agenda for change on the ground. It has, more than anything else, a labor orientation, despite even business groups being involved. It's going to change things on the ground. And the person organizing--sort of--A. Philip Randolph is the president, but the person doing the work on a day-to-day basis is John P. Davis. He was there at the Negro Industrial League, there at the Joint Committee for International Recovery, and he's really running the National Negro Congress. And he runs it for the length of the NNC's existence, which is not quite a decade.

Now one of the first things the Congress does successfully, aside from just meeting, is establish a Southern Negro Youth Congress, essentially the youth arm of the Congress. The Southern Negro Youth Con--Congress had its inaugural conference half a year late in February 1937 in Richmond, Virginia, and it makes its headquarters there for a number of years. With the guidance of the Southern Negro Youth Conference leaders, it becomes a permanent organization and almost immediately organizes five thousand tobacco workers into the Tobacco Stemmers and Laborers Industrial union. Very soon after, an SNYC leads a sit down strike in--at a Virginia Tobacco Company and garn--and, and gets wage increases of twenty to thrity-three percent. This is remarkable. The Southern Negro Youth Congress, these are, these are people your age and a little bit older, going down to Richmond, Virginia, the heart of the Confederacy, and organizing black workers into a union and getting wages--wage increases for them. It's nothing really short of astonishing.

By 1939, when the third annual conference of the SNYC gathers in Birm--gathers, they meet in Birmingham, Alabama. Over six hundred delegates are in attendance. It's the largest conference to date. The themes of the conference revolved around citizenship, equal opportunity, and black culture. These are themes that by now must be familiar to all of you. I've been talking about it during this course, after all. Again, themes from the Niagara Movement, but in this case with the students, a different type of cultural emphasis. I think a hangover, in a sense, from the Harlem Renaissance. But the Southern Negro Youth Congress was not another middle-class black venture. I'm thinking too that's sort of the cultural producers of the Renaissance. It espoused a democratic socialist vision. It was militantly interracial. It offered its full support to the Congress Industrial Organization, that breakaway set of labor unions that actually welcomed black workers. And, this is the most important part, it's very quietly Communist. The Southern Negro Youth Congress moves its headquarters from Richmond down to Birmingham and establishes a watchdog presence in the Deep South. It wages suffrage campaigns, you know, trying to get people to vote, anti-poll tax campaigns. It tries to fight against police brutality.

Now the Southern Negro Youth Congress is important because of its Communist involvement, certainly, but also because you can see it as a preface to the civil rights activities that defined Birmingham some twenty years later, and that as we'll see next week, you start seeing a lot of these kinds of activities in other places throughout the South, through other organizations. Now I'll ex--expand upon this point later on. It's very important. The Southern Negro Youth Congress is but one example that forces, if you think about it, forces a re-periodization of the Civil Rights Movement. I'll leave that alone there for a moment. Well, the SNYC begins to fade as we get into the 1940s. Its male leaders go off to fight; its female leaders do not remain youthful. I mean, neither do the men of course, but the women are still at home. It's no longer a ¡°youth congress.¡±  They're not regenerating themselves. And the whispering about its linkage to the Communist Party really prevents it from becoming a major political force after the Soviet-Nazi pact in 1939, when the soviet--when Hitler and Stalin get together, saying, "We won't fight against each other," which alienates a lot of people who were supporting the Communist Party in the United States.

Meanwhile, back in the National Negro Congress, I'll roll back the clock a few years. Randolph, A. Phil--A. Philip Randolph, he's the president, is hearing more whispering about Communist involvement in the National Negro Congress, and he's not happy about it. He fights--he denies it at first, goes, "No, we are, you know, we are an independent organization. Even though we've modeled ourselves, modeled ourselves after Communist ideologies as far as developing a Popular Front of all people from different kinds of places coming together to fight towards one goal, we are not Communists."  But then it becomes clear that Communists have infiltrated the National Negro Congress, mainly through the Congress of Industrial Organization. So white labor organizers, Randolph concludes, are bringing Communism into this organization, and he wants no part of it. Randolph, after denying it for a while, goes to the national convention in 1940 where he's going to stand up in front of the Congress, the National Negro Congress and resign, and resign with fire, talking about how the Communists do not have our best interests at heart. He's basically booed off the stage. I mean, the communists are now taking control of the Negro Congress. And John P. Davis, where is he through all of this?  Well, he's--he¡¯s a communist actually. And so, you know, he's caught in a rock and a hard place, but sides with the Congress. And that¡¯s where he, that's where he continues to reside for a handful more years.
Chapter 2. The Marian Anderson Easter Sunday Concert [00:16:06]

Now that's in 1940, and Randolph's about to go off and start something quite different in response to his departure from the Nation--National Negro Congress. And we'll get to that towards the end of the lecture. While all of this is going on--all of this meaning the National Negro Congress becoming organized, having its conferences, turning more towards Communism and then Randolph breaking from it--you have a series of events happening on the cultural front, cultural and political front, that sort of galvanizes black opinion and leads to a new set of political possibilities, and that's the Marian Anderson Easter Sunday concert in 1939. Marian Anderson, black woman, regarded as one of the world's greatest living contraltos. She¡¯s--she sings opera. Her case is well known, partly for her international stature, partly for the other high profile whites who are involved in it, and partly for the symbolic significance attached to the controversy. Let me give you the history behind it, and the controversy, and explain its significance.

Howard University School of Music had regularly been scheduling Marian Anders--Marian Anderson to come back from Europe. She was born in the U.S. but couldn't establish a career in the U.S. She goes off to Europe and becomes a fan--a, a superstar in Europe. But Howard School of Music starts--is schedule--as her star is rising in Europe, is scheduling her to come back to the U.S. to give conf--concerts, and they've been on campus. As her popularity rises, they can't house her on campus any more, and in 1936 and thirty-seven, the Howard concert had been moved to a local black high school auditorium. By 1938, Marian Anderson's fees are such, and the demand is such, they need a larger venue in order to spon--to hold the concert. They went into the black commercial district, which is right next to Howard, went to a theater that was bigger than the black high school auditorium, had it there. In 1939, the fees are greater, the demand is greater. Where are we going to have a concert? 

The School of Music goes to the Daughters of the American Revolution, the DAR. The Daughters of the American Revolution, a social political organization--I think more social in this moment until it becomes politicized--of women who can date back their lineage to people who fought in the Revolutionary War. At that time and really only until the last ten or fifteen years, a very white organization and very conservative organization. And they manage Constitution Hall, which is the largest venue in the city. It's still there today. Well, they go to the Daughters of the American Revolution, the School of Music does, "We'd like to have Marian Anderson performing in, in Constitution Hall. Would you let her sing there?"  Now the DAR maintained a strictly segregated policy. Now in D.C. theaters, it was quite common to have segregated audiences. If blacks were allowed in, they'd only be allowed up in the balcony. You could have blacks on stage always, because they "dance so well," they "sing so beautifully" as the stereotype goes. But DAR was different: no blacks in the audience period, and no blacks on stage. It was an all white venue all the time.

The Howard University School of Music, rebuffed by this, goes to a local white high school, which has a much larger auditorium than the black high school that had been used before and the Rialto, and it's rebuffed again. Black leaders in the District then form the Marian Anderson Citizens Committee to fight these decisions. It's a coalition of local clergy, teachers, civic and fraternal organizations, trying to basically knock down these doors. Behind the scenes, however, a man named Charles Houston, a lawyer at this point for the NAACP--he's the first general counsel. He had been brought to Howard a decade earlier to reorganize its law school and starts teaching the first civil rights law classes in the country, the law school does. Charles Houston gets involved behind the scenes, as well as the NAACP. They start organizing mass meetings, letters of support start being sent in to these different organizations, and they're focusing on the white high school. They go to--They're going to the, the Board of Education. The Board of Education says, "Okay, we'll, we¡¯ll come to a compromise on this. We will allow Marian Anderson to perform at the white high school, Central High. We'll let it be integrated. But this will be a one-time event and you may not use this"--you, the citizens organizing the committee, and quietly, Charles Houston--"you may not use this as a precedent from challenging separate but equal educational systems in the District of Columbia.¡± 

Well, the fact is, that's what Houston was trying to do the whole time, once he got involved, because this is a great way to break down the color line in the school system, using Marian Anderson as a symbolic vehicle. It's a compromise the protestors refused--refused to accept and the School of Board called their bluff [laughs[--the Board of Education called their bluff. So the NAACP and Charles Houston go to the White House. They go to the White House via Mary McLeod Bethune, talked about on Monday, who gets them to have an audience with Eleanor Roosevelt; Eleanor Roosevelt who's a member of the DAR, incredibly popular syndicated-syndicated columnist. Approaches the DAR and they tell her, "No, we're not breaking this policy," and she resigns in protest and writes a very famous column about this, and her embarrassment for the DAR. Eleanor Roosevelt talks to Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior, himself, like Eleanor Roosevelt, considered a "friend of the race," as what the phrase was at the time. Harold Ickes steps in and arranges a concert on Easter Sunday in 1939 for Marian Anderson at the Lincoln Memorial. As the Secretary of the Interior, he, he, he controlled the federal land and controlled what happened on the National Mall.

On the day in question, Ickes steps up to the microphone and introduces Marian Anderson. One prominent journal remarked after the fact that, I'm quoting here, "The brevity and force of his speech was destined to rival Lincoln's Gettysburg Address."  Now whether that's true or not is a--well I don't think we remember this speech, so it didn't really rival the Gettysburg Address. But it is short and it is powerful. This is what he says here, one excerpt of what he says:

Harold Ickes:  "Genius, like justice, is blind. For Genius, with the tip of her wings, has touched this woman, who, if it had not been for the great mind of Jefferson, if it had not been for the great heart of Lincoln, would not be able to stand among us today as a free individual in a free land. Genius. Genius draws no color line."

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  You start hearing a plane flying overhead there. It was something of a circus atmosphere. He says,

"Genius, like justice, is blind. For Genius has touched with the tip of her wings this woman, who, if it had not been for the great mind of Jefferson, if it had not been for the great heart of Lincoln, would not be able to stand among us today as a free individual in a free land. Genius. Genius draws no color line."

It's a powerful statement coming from a representative of the federal government. Now four hours before Ickes steps to the microphone, four hours before the concert begins, people start arriving at the National Mall and the Lincoln Memorial. And what they find there is really quite remarkable. D.C. is a very segregated city during this era. What they find is an absence, an absence of "colored only" sections, an absence of, you know, "White section. No colored allowed."  Seventy-five thousand people crowd the Mall, and it may not sound like a dramatic number to you in our day of, you know, millions showing up at the Mall, but this is historic. And it's also opera, which is not known as the people's music, right?  Seventy-five thousand people crowd the Mall to hear Anderson's performance, and an untold number of people listen to the performance on radio around the country, aired live. Planes are circling overhead trying to understand the scene that's going on there.

This is a famous image: Marian Anderson, long fur coat, singing just with piano accompanying her. Steps up to the microphone and in a powerful yet dignified rebuke to the DAR, Anderson simply begins her concert in this way:(singing) "My country, 'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing;" She sounded a bit like that, maybe a bit better. Eloquent, powerful, subtle, undeniable. She is in this moment claiming the country as much--It belongs as much to her as it belongs to the Daughters of the American Revolution. Everybody there got it. She didn't have to say, you know, "I'm so glad to be here today. It's lovely. You know, D.C., how are you?" 

[students laughing]

You didn't have to do that kind of stuff; simply declared, "This is my country too."  And in fact, as an aside, it¡¯s--the inauguration of Barack Obama, something, I don't know if I'll talk about it or not at the end of the class, but when Aretha Franklin stands up to sing My Country, 'Tis of Thee--she, I mean, it's a, culturally a very dense inauguration. I mean, all inaugurations are rich with symbolism, but this one was rather remarkable. She was singing My Country, 'Tis of Thee, for the, you know, that people would get it in the audience, but there's a whole other level of understanding for those people who know this story and what Marian Anderson did with this particular exhortation. And I, I've heard, if you watched the HBO special the day before the inauguration, they explained some of this. I didn't see it; but, and many people didn't. The significance of Aretha Franklin's performance of that particular song was lost on many folks, but it was a reckoning back to this moment.

The moment's important, not just because, you know, it's a classy way of being a civil rights protestor, but it's important for these different reasons. With Eleanor Roosevelt and Harold Ickes giving their very public support to the, the Citizens Committee for Marian Anderson, and for the right for her to sing at the DAR, it suggests to African Americans that the federal government, at the highest levels, in the White House, "really does care about us."  They'd been working on the Black Cabinet. That¡¯s--They've been going out and changing things. We're now as a group beginning to vote for Democrats anyway, through--because of FDR. And now the First Lady, the Secretary of Interior, are saying, "Genius draws no color line."  Of course, it's the symbolism wrapped up in performing under the protective gaze of the Great Emancipator. That's not lost on anybody either. But it's also felt on the very local level in ways that's lost to history often.

When I was working on my first book, my dissertation in fact, I was interviewing a longtime D.C. resident. He was then about eighty years old. And we were just talking about this era, you know, in Washington, D.C. and, and what it meant to be black and struggle with the color line. And this concert comes up, and he said something I've never forgotten. And he says, this is a quote, it¡¯s burned into my brain: "After that concert"--and he was there, I should say. "After that concert, everything looked different in America as far as blacks were concerned."  "After that concert, everything looked different in America as far as blacks were concerned."    Now he's not talking literally, because the day after Marian Anderson sang, it wasn't like if you were black, you could go into a local restaurant that's not in the black section of town, or at Union Station, the only other place blacks could go for a public restaurant. You couldn't go in someplace else and get a meal. You all of a sudden couldn't get a job that was denied to you, you know, the week before. So in terms of literal bread and butter issues, there's no change. But at the level of symbolic possibilities, at the level of what blacks can articulate and think as maybe achievable, fundamental change happens with this concert.

Now it's also important because the public outcry surrounding Mary Anderson's concert is happening in the context of a larger battle of a war or rhetoric against the Nazi doctrines of racial supremacy. So you can't just understand this concert in the context of an event that happened in Washington, D.C., or an event that happened in the U.S. It's an event that has global ramifications, especially for the way in which the U.S. federal government is struggling against a war of words with Nazi and--Nazi and fascist regimes. "The U.S. didn't have a leg to stand on," the Nazis would say, "because they're just as racist as we are."  This is very important for the U.S. as it really does enter the Second World War and continues on through the Cold War, something I'll touch down upon once or twice, I'm sure, in this course. As the U.S. becomes an international power, which is this part of the story, the 1920s and thirties and forties especially, its domestic politics become scrutinized much more closely. World War II, which we're on the cusp of getting involved in, is a war to stop the spread of fascism, but if the U.S. can't handle its own fascistic tendencies internal, it's a war of hypocrisy.

So you start seeing there, in the Scottsboro boys, reaching back to Monday, and the way they use it as cultural markers for the Communists, Marion Anderson being used as a cultural marker of democratic possibilities, blacks being used as cultural markers of political possibilities, of what this country is supposed to be for everybody, and what the country's supposed to be for African Americans, and what the country's supposed to be for the world. Now this affords--oh, one other, this is a very famous image, of course, of Marian Anderson. There's another image that I show up here just for the sake of a, a quick side lesson on how you read images. There's a way in which, you know, we--we are, in our minds' eye, we are here sitting just below her right shoulder, and we see dignitaries at the micro--at the, at the stand.

This image I dug up tells a very different story. Except for--I¡¯ll use the mouse here--except for this area here, which is cordoned off for reasons I honestly don't know, everything else you see, except for that tree line, going off to, beyond the Reflecting Pool, are people, sitting there in an integrated audience, seventy-five thousand people. It just sort of gives you a different sense of the way this might have felt if you were actually there. And because it's harder to make out Marian Anderson, I'm as--I¡¯m assuming that's why this is not one of the more famous iconic pictures. You just, here's just somebody's back standing in front of an audience. But it really was quite a visual spectacle, and I think offers ways for you to think about how you read images, for instance, perspective being very important.
Chapter 3. A. Philip Randolph and the March on Washington Movement [00:33:38]

Now I was talking before the little caveat, I was talking about political symbolism and the roles and the ways in which African Americans were political footballs. And then I wanted to transition to a story that helps us understand how blacks start using this to their great advantage and that's the story of A. Philip Randolph. A. Philip Randolph, whose name has come up several times already in the course, and I'm going to devote the rest of the lecture to him quickly, he is one of the most important transitional political figures in African American history. He was born in 1889, dies in 1979. I mean, the ranges of what happens in his lifetime is really astonishing. But here's a person who's involved in the political scene in the nineteen-teens and twenties, taking a frontline argument on issues. And he's there in 1941 at a moment of, of powerful symbolic importance, I'll be talking about in a moment. And he's there in 1963 when King steps up to the microphone and delivers his "Dream" speech. Incredibly important political person. Helps us navigate from a period of Booker T. Washington political power, ideology of accommodation, and through his consistent socialist politics--Randolph couldn't stand Communists but was an ardent socialist--transitions African American political voice to a very different kind--different kind of voice.

Now there's three phases to Randolph's career through 1941. In 1914, he moves to New York City, becomes witness, well part of and witness to the Great Migration and sees the way it transforms that particular urban site. He sees the NAACP and the National Urban League as people--organizations fighting out for resources--fighting over resources, certainly affecting workers' lives by their policies, but not really at the workers' level. NAACP being very much a top-down organization, with assimilationist and middle-class norms. The National Urban League trying to help people on the ground, but, you know, in the pocket of corporate--corporations and helping basically break up labor unions. And Randolph says, "But what about the workers themselves?"  And so he starts looking around for different ways to get involved in workers' movements, labor movements. In 1917, he declares himself a Socialist, urges blacks to resist the U.S. draft and to confine their fighting to the domestic front. He can't stand Du Bois's call to close our--close ranks. And around the same time he, along with another black socialist named Chandler Owen, start publishing a mess--a magazine called The Messenger. Through The Messenger, Randolph calls for a bold, black socialist leadership, calls for radicals who would not be afraid to challenge accepted notions of, of how a U.S. society should operate. If Washington is on this part of a spectrum, and Du Bois is over here on the opposite side, Randolph's even further beyond Du Bois politically.

He and Owen are characterized as Bolsheviks by members of Congress. They're investigated by the Department of Justice, and they declare in response, "We would be glad to see a Bolshevik government substituted in the South in place of your Bourbon, reactionary, vote stolen, misrepresentative, democratic regime."  That sounds like, you know, Black Panther talking here, doesn't it?  In 1919, Randolph says that he's thankful for the Russian Revolution, the greatest achievement of the twentieth century. But when the American version--when the American Community Party is organized in twenty-one, Randolph remains a Socialist and dedicates the rest of his life really to preventing social--Communists from controlling or representing black America. By the mid-twenties, The Messenger as a journal is actually not doing that well. Randolph still casting about for ways in which to connect with black workers, and a labor union is being--is organized, and recognized that Randolph really has the voice that they need to be heard in a larger--a larger scene, and that's the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids.

In twenty-five, 1925, Randolph's recruited to head the union of Sleeping Car Porters, and then when organized, trying to get the American Federation--the Pullman Company, people who run the trains, own the trains, to recognize that union, and then the American Federation of Labor to recognize that union. Efforts are made to get better working conditions and higher wages from Pullman. Pullman refuses both and tries blackballing Randolph, tries to, you know, crush him. Randolph becomes very unpopular with black and white groups alike for his radical stances, but the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters does earn the--gather the support of the NAACP, the Urban League, and eventually the American Federation of Labor. It wins partial recognition in 1926, and in 1929, more recognition, but still not full recognition. A decade later after starting this battle, Randolph does win for the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids full recognition from the AFL and, a year later, from the Pullman Porters--the Pullman porters--I mean from the AFL, ex--from the Pullman Company. The wages go up, job security goes up, benefits go up. The Pullman porters actually become a great vehicle to attain middle-class status for a segment of black America. In fact, the Pullman porters, the U.S. post, the military, over the course of the twentieth century, are the three great ways for black Americans to transition to middle-class status.

With Randolph's victories with the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids getting fully recognized finally in thirty-six and thirty-seven, he is seen as, without doubt, the most important black labor leader in the country. This is why he's selected to run the National Negro Congress. There's nobody else who has his access, who has his power, and his influence. But as you know, Randolph is a staunch anti-Communist, and as the National Negro Congress develops further, he realizes there's no place for him any more in that organization. So Randolph starts thinking of a different way to achieve justice for blacks, full citizenship rights and decent jobs for blacks in the United States. The National Negro Congress is not going to be the vehicle. What Randolph sees is that as the U.S. war industry starts to develop, as it's arming Europe--Western Europe, or the Allies, I should say--as the U.S. war machine, industrial war machine develops, these are the best paying jobs in the country, as far as, you know, factory work is concerned, and blacks can't get those jobs. They can work--they can push a broom in the factory, but they can't roll steel, or whatever you do in a munitions factory.

Factories run overtime. There's money to be made hand over fist. Blacks couldn't get those jobs. There's movements being made to increase the size of the army, a powerfully segregated army. Randolph says, "Where do we fit in, in all of this? We're second class in the factory and in the military."  Randolph and a group of other leaders go to Franklin Roosevelt, September of 1940, with a seven point plan, that, I mean, I'm not going to go into now in the interests of time, but essentially calling for the desegregation or the integration of the U.S. military, calling for access to all jobs in the defense industries, essentially anti-discrimination policies. The plea is ignored. FDR, always being afraid of losing his coalition of southern Democrats who would be upset by any sort of racial progressive politics. Blacks are going into the army certainly, but they're going into all black units, trained in separate places, trained most often by white officers. A lot of the same story that you heard in World War I. Domestic hiring situation is a joke. Blacks are not being hired in factory floor jobs. As white men go off to fight in the war, white women are brought into the factory, a radical change for women's possibilities, certainly, but black men and black women are not getting these jobs.

So in January of 1941, Randolph proposes--I mean he's no longer with the National Negro Congress. He's broken from them. He proposes a March on Washington, and he demands that something be done regarding black access to jobs, and of course for the integration of the military. And he calls at first for ten thousand blacks to march on Washington. And as that met with enthusiasm, he calls for fifty thousand. Then he calls for one hundred thousand blacks to march on Washington that summer, on July 1st, if there is no change. It doesn't seem like bluster. Things have changed, on the ground and in the air. As we head into the summer, into June, people in D.C. are getting concerned. "My god, what if one hundred thousand negroes come into this city and are angry?  What are we going to do?"  And Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, dispatches two of his most trusted sort of network political operatives to talk with A. Philip Randolph to calm him down. He sends Fiorello La Guardia, then the mayor of New York City, liberal on race issues. "Please talk to Randolph and tell him to call off this march."  No dice. He sends his wife, the most powerful proponent on these issues in his pocket, he sends his wife. Randolph goes, "No dice. I'm not, I¡¯m not canceling this march."  Finally FDR says, "Okay, Mr. Randolph, come to see me." 

It's a week before the march is set to go off. Randolph goes into the White House, meets with Roosevelt. And Roosevelt says, Roosevelt says, "If you call off the march, I'll issue an executive order with 'teeth' in it," as the word was. And Randolph says, "Okay."  Roosevelt signs Executive Order 8802 on June 25th, 1941. It says there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color or national origin, and it's the duty of the employers and of labor organizations to provide for the full and equitable participation of all workers in defense industries without discrimination based on race, creed, color, national origin. It sets up a Fair Employment Practices Committee that would be a watchdog organization. It couldn't do anything but give bad publicity to a factory that's not hiring black workers. But people didn't want to be, to be seen somehow as un-American, so FE--FEPC could make some changes along the margins, along the edges of things.

You'll notice that the executive order did not end segregation in the military. It's simply calling for industry changes. Randolph doesn¡¯t win that battle and won't win it for a while. Now blacks hail the Executive Order 8802 as the most significant order since the Emancipation Proclamation. This is a new era, and it's not a new era just because of what the President's calling for. It's on the ground, what happens is a little, a little messier. It doesn¡¯t immediately integrate all industries. But what's really important is the linkage now, the symbolic possibilities and real political change, and that is a prominent leader of the African American community called the President's bluff; was called into the White House and they negotiated, face to face, to find a resolution. That's one of the things, once the genie's out of that bottle, it can't go back in. So black access to the White House is now direct, to the President. Presidents from this point on cannot afford to ignore black leaders in the way they have been doing since the founding of the Republic. So you have in A. Philip Randolph and the March on Washington moment the merging of the symbolic politics of possibility and the real politics of possibility. And it is a merger that would go on to define the civil rights movement that we know about so well over the next thrity or forty years. Thank you very much.
Lecture 13 - The Road to Brown and Little Rock [February 24, 2010]
Chapter 1. A Tallying of the State of Segregation in 1951 [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  I want to start with, I guess for lack of a better word, two vignettes. One, and it really is lack of a better word, vignette is actually a series of, of statistics. You don't need to keep them from your notes, but I want you to understand them from an impressionistic point of view. These--this is a tallying of the state of segregation in 1951. It's a random point in time in the South. In May of 1951, the state of Texas did not allow interracial boxing matches. Florida did not allow white and black students to use the same editions of textbooks. In Alabama, a white woman was not allowed to take care of a black male patient. North Carolina required separate washrooms in its factories. South Carolina required them in its cotton mills. Four other states required them in their mines. In six states--and there¡¯s a, I'm going to be reading a list in numbers of states. They're overlapping in different combinations, I'm quite sure--in six states, white and black prisoners could not be chained together.

In seven states, parks, playgrounds, bathing and fishing and boating facilities, amusement parks, race tracks, pool halls, circuses, theaters and public halls were all segregated. Ten states required separate waiting rooms for bus and train travelers. Fourteen states required black passengers to ride in the back of buses and streetcars. Some other combination of fourteen states segregated railroad passengers on trips within their borders. Some other combination of fourteen states required mental--segregated mental patients. Some seventeen states required segregation of public schools. Four other states permitted the practice if local communities wished it. And in, and in Washington DC, the custom had prevailed for nearly ninety years. In eleven, in eleven states--and this one I find is actually breathtaking for the absurdity of all of this, or maybe even the passion for all of this--in eleven states or eleven states operated separate schools for the blind. So even if you could not see each other, you could not be in the same space if you were white and if you were black. It's a thorough going segregation across many different lines, many different vectors, of how you operate as a citizen in the world. 
Chapter 2. Melba Beals¡¯ Memoir: Warriors Don¡¯t Cry [00:02:51]

Now that's 1950, fifty-one. I want to read to you an excerpt from the memoir Warriors Don't Cry by Melba Beals, who was one of the, who would become one of the, would become one of the Little Rock Nine, who'd deseg--desegregate Central High School. We¡¯ll be talking--I'll talk a little bit about Central High School in Monday's lecture. We're actually chronologically not getting up to that point in today's lecture. But I want to read to you an excerpt from 1954--of events that happened in 1954--to help underscore, undergird the extent to which the kind of higher level organizing and political work and legal affairs that will be the bulk of today's lecture, to underscore the way in which these things really made themselves manifest on the ground. So Melba Beals writes very early in her book, reflecting back to when she was, I believe, twelve years old. She's walking back home from school on the day that Brown v., Brown v., Brown versus the Board of Education decision had been announced. And teachers all--the teachers told their students, black teachers, black students, "Go straight home. Don't take any shortcuts. Just go straight home."

"As I entered the persimmon field, I sank deep into my thoughts, but a few steps past the big tree at the front of the path, I heard a rustling sound. I stood perfectly still, looking all around. I didn¡¯t see a soul. Suddenly, as I came near to the end of the field, a man¡¯s gravel voice snatched me from the secret place in my head.

'You want a ride, girl?' He didn¡¯t sound at all like anybody I knew. There is was again, that stranger's voice calling out to me. 'Want a ride?'

'Who is it?' I asked, barely able to squeeze the words out.

'I got candy in the car, lots of candy.'

I crept forward, and then I saw him¡ªa big white man, even taller than my father, broad and huge, like a wrestler. He was coming toward me fast. I turned on my heels and fled in the opposite direction, back the way I had come.

'You'd better come on and take a ride home, you hear me girl?'

'No sir!' I yelled, 'No, thank you,' but he kept coming.

My heart was racing almost as fast as my feet. I couldn¡¯t hear anything except for the sound of my saddle shoes pounding the ground and the thud of his feet close behind me. That¡¯s when he started talking about 'niggers' wanting to go to school with his children and how he wasn¡¯t going to stand for it. My cries for help drowned out the sound of his words, but he laughed and said it was no use because nobody would hear me. I was running as fast as I could. The lace on my shoe came untied and my feet got tangled. As I hit the ground, I bit down hard on my tongue. I felt his strong hands clutch my back. I bolted up, struggling to get away. He pulled me down and turned me on my back. I looked up into his face, looming close above me like the monster on a movie screen. I struggled against him but he was too strong. He slapped me hard across the face. I covered my eyes with my hands and waited for him to strike me again. Instead, I felt him squirm against me, and then I saw him taking his pants down. In my house, private parts were always kept private. I couldn't figure out what he was doing, but I knew it had to be bad. I scratched and kicked and thrashed against him with every ounce of strength I could muster. His huge fists smashed hard against my face. I struggled to push him back and to keep the dark curtain of unconsciousness from descending over me.

'I¡¯ll show you niggers the Supreme Court can¡¯t run my life,' he said, as he--as his hand ripped at my underpants. A voice inside my head told me I was going to die, but there was nothing I could do about it. White men were in charge."

Someone comes to her rescue within about four or five seconds of this moment, before she's actually raped. One of her classmates she didn't really know that well knocks the guy over the head with a brick and she's able to escape to safety. Thus begins her journey towards becoming one of the Little Rock Nine. These are the memories of a twelve year old.

Now I want to set that stage about systemic segregation and the ways in which people were, I mean from my personal perspective, were driven mad by the Supreme--Supreme Court decision of fifty-four. To sort of underscore, for lack of a better phrase, the intensity of the moment, a period of profound ambiguity in this country and a period of profound change for blacks as well as whites, conservatives as well as liberals. And over the course of today's lecture and really Monday's lecture, we're going to start canvassing the ways in which--[student sneezes] Bless You--the ways in which this period of, of incredible instability in the United States was made, was felt on many different levels, in different ways. So much of today's lecture is context, for much of the, for going across the 1940s up to Brown v. Board.
Chapter 3. The Fair Employment Practices Committee [00:07:57]

Now I ended the last lecture before the midterm talking about A. Philip Randolph's March on Washington Movement, his bluff with FDR, FDR's issuing of Executive Order 8802, and the creation of the FEPC. I was trying to cram a lot of things into the lecture. Give me two minutes to talk about the FEPC very quickly and move us into the 1940s.

The FEPC, Fair Employment--Fair Employment Practices Commission--Committee, held high profile hearings in major cities about segregation in defense industry factories. But it was essentially powerless to do anything except for embarrass the companies and the factories that are, that are continuing these practices. Now in terms of, so literal change, the FEPC is not doing much, as it turns out. But again, since we're wrestling with--I, I've been talking about the tension between the symbolic and the real. At the symbolic level, the FEPC contributes to the, to blacks' reorientation away from notions of, you know, systems of white patronage. They have to rely on white patrons to make ends meet, but they could turn to the federal government instead, but the federal government, and I started talking about it with the Black Cabinet through Marian Anderson's concert on Easter Sunday, 1939, the federal government is now standing in, in complicated ways, certainly, but still standing in and keeping an eye on the quality of black life.
Chapter 4. The March on Washington Movement and the Congress on Racial Equality [00:09:32]

Well, here we are in 1941 and 1942, the U.S. is now involved in the Second World War. And as you'll remember from going back to the First World War, as, as the U.S. is about to get involved and W. E. B. Du Bois called on African Americans to close ranks, but then called on them to return fighting. You have black soldiers enlisting in terrifically large numbers. You have a lot of the same kind of troubling dynamics about training black soldiers, their treatment abroad, positive by foreign troops and foreign citizens and negative by U.S. troops. And you have the treatment coming home that is scandalous. The Pittsburgh Courier, along with the Chicago Defender, the two most important black newspapers of the day, the Pittsburgh Courier, aware that the same dynamic might repeat itself, that is, you know, black soldiers fighting for citizenship rights and being denied them, in February of 1942 begins a campaign. It¡¯s--It is a publicity campaign; it's nothing beyond that, but it becomes very popular. It's the Double V campaign, Double V, two Vs: that there would be victory over fascism abroad and victory over racial discrimination at home. This is just like Du Bois's call, "We return. We return from fighting. We return fighting."  Okay?  But twenty-three years have passed. It's the same call, it's the same agenda. That's the important thing to understand.

Now Randolph bluffs FDR into signing this executive order, and Randolph realizes he has an important opportunity here to make something out of this bluff and this March on Washington Movement becomes an organization, not just one person trying to organize a march, but it actually becomes its own grassroots organization, the MO--MOWM. There's no easy way to say it. The March on Washington Movement embodies a certain set of tactics and they are, for lack of a better phrase, racial tactics. Randolph, as you already know, was an anti-communist. He was deeply concerned about white communists infiltrating the National Negro Congress and when it happened, he broke from it. And he saw that the March on Washington Movement was a way--by--he kept it all-black. I should have said that first. It was an all-black movement. He saw by keeping it all-black, it would reduce or even eliminate the chance that the Communist Party would infiltrate the organization, since the Communist Party was predominantly white. But Randolph was very clear, since we're in a time of war, to go to great ends to make sure his movement was not considered black nationalist. Although it's all-black, it's not black nationalist. And Randolph declares, and I'm quoting here:

"We condemn all dictatorships, Fascist, Nazi and Communists. We are loyal, patriotic Americans all. But if American democracy will not defend its defenders; if American democracy will not protect its protectors; if American democracy will not give job to its--jobs to its toilers because of race or color; if American democracy will not issue--insure equality of opportunity, freedom and justice to its citizens, black and white, it is a hollow mockery and belies the principles for which it is supposed to stand."

The March on Washington Movement is all-black. It certainly welcomes white support, but not within the organization itself, and it is profoundly patriotic as far as its assertions--as far as its assertions are concerned. On the ground, the March on Washington Movement engaged in mass, nonviolent, direct action, a blend of Gandhi's tactics and Randolph's experiences with labor sit-down strikes. He believed in small direct actions, you know, going into one region or, you know, a part of the country with small and highly symbolic acts of resistance. You know it has, It's sort of a hodgepodge of org--of, of, of , of groups operating under its banner, doing different things in different places, but all embracing an all-black agenda, an all-black constituency, mass nonviolent, direct action.

There's another group that's founded in 1942, a year after the March on Washington Movement, that embraced this secular--that embraced a different agenda from the March on Washington--a different organizing agenda, pardon me, from the March on Washington Movement. It was interracial civil rights organization called the Congress on Racial Equality, CORE, Congress on Racial Equality, an off-shoot of the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation. CORE was founded in 1942. Its director was James Farmer, and one of the principal organizers was a man, was a man named Bayard Rustin, someone we'll hear more about in the next couple of weeks. CORE and the March on Washington Movement were two of the main groups operating in, in the 1940s to educate blacks to use nonviolent direct action. So they shared that strategic logic.

CORE was interracial; March on Washington Movement was all-black. The March on Washington Movement built its base on the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids Union, using Randolph's organizing skills, and really try to reach out to lower-class blacks as well. CORE was significantly smaller than March on Washington Movement, and it was focused on essentially the demographic you represent: college aged student, highly educated, interracial, and essentially elitist. CORE's mission statement says that it has one purpose: to eliminate racial discrimination, and it has one method: interracial nonviolent, direct action. And of course, style was to test, to negotiate, to confer and then to sit-in. Test, negotiate, confer, and sit-in.

Now I¡¯m going to move away from these two groups rather quickly, but I wanted you to understand these different organizing logics, although they're sharing the same strategic mode of engagement. Understand they're happening in the 1940s as well, because as I hope to make clear through this lecture and through much of the next couple of weeks' lectures, it's very critical you start to re-periodize the Civil Rights Movement. The kinds of things that I just mentioned here, I hope that you will recognize from your basic high school American History class, talking about the Civil Rights Movement, that famous movement between fifty-four and sixty-eight, at the most, okay?  The strategies of, of, of, sort of the high theater of the Civil Rights Movement roots go back to the 1940s and beyond, with direct corrections and a, a direct lineage of, of sorts, of resistance. You need to understand this; it's rather important.
Chapter 5. Politics in the 1940s: A Period of Transition and War [00:17:13]

Now what's happening in the 1940s?  What's the scene in which the March on Washington Movement and CORE are operating?  The country is in transition. It's in war. As I already mentioned, the Great Migration happening in the first two decades of the twentieth century. There's another migration happening now that dwarfs the Great Migration, a migration of African Americans, many of whom are following defense industry jobs out west and in the North. Essentially, the black population you know of in Los Angeles is there because of, of defense industry jobs and factory jobs during this period of time. This is the moment, over the next decade, when African Americans move from being predominantly a rural population--I think it's about forty percent at that point--to over fifty or fifty-five percent urban. So it's a transition, profound transition, for African Americans, as far as demographics are concerned.

Now with this migration, like the first Great Migration, you have crisis, pressure for housing, cultural styles, political battlefields. Nineteen forty-three is a spectacular year for crisis. You have race riots happening in the summer of forty-three in forty-seven different cities. One of the most famous is the Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles, which involved not blacks in this case, but Mexicans, and Mexican Americans, and white navy--I think it's navy. I'm pretty sure it's navy--members of the navy attacking Los Angelinos who happened to be Mexican, for straying across racial and social lines. The worst riot happens in Detroit, a mere ten days before a March on Washington Movement convention in Chicago. The riot, in all of its violence, colored the March on Washington Movement in Chicago--convention in Chicago, and so militant race leadership is seen as too provocative and un-American. And really, people can deny the fact that blacks actually were beginning to get jobs in these factories, because factories were so desperate for workers.

You have migration, racial violence, a country at war, the March on Washington Movement agitating, making some headway as far as its long-term goals, but also having a narrower range in which it could operate, because, you know, appearing un-American is the last thing you want to do at this moment in time. It's something that Randolph himself articulates. Meanwhile, membership in the NAACP skyrockets, as the organiza--organization appears to be a more moderate and reasonable location for civil rights agitation than the all-black March on Washington Movement, even though it's making, it¡¯s a pro-American stance, and more moderate than this upstart CORE that people don't really know what to make of yet. So you have now, by the mid-1940s, the NAACP becoming, turning into this moderate organization, by outward appearances, where it was on the edge, sort of the avant garde, when it was founded, and for the first decade, decade, two decades of its existence. Things are shifting.

Things shift fundamentally in 1944 in a legal case, Smith v. Allwright, that outlaws the white, outlaws the white-only primary. And I have to apologize. I have to go really quickly through a lot of these things, because I lost a lecture by the midterm, so I'm not going to get into the details. But in the Smith v. Allwright case, the white, white primaries, white primaries are now outlawed, and now liberal groups, broadly defined, start going after a whole set of different means of exclusion, of preserving, essentially an all-white vote. Groups start going after literacy tests that were, that were at the point of absurdity, where a registrar could actually ask somebody, "How many bubbles are there in a bar of soap?" as a way to exclude them. People knew they had to act in terms of trying to expand the right to vote, or access to the ballot box, ballot box, by just looking at Mississippi.

In Mississippi, you have over three hundred and fifty thousand blacks who are eligible to register, register to vote. Mississippi has a huge black population. And of that three hundred and fifty thousand, only twenty-five hundred manage to vote in 1946. It's an all-white vote, because of all the various ways in which Mississippi registrars and voters are being told to eliminate the black vote. In fact, very famously, Senator Bilbo from, from Mississippi, who was a virulent racist, would go around organizing registrars of voters of--before actual election night, telling them all these different ways in which you can eliminate the black vote, and said, you know, "If worst comes to worst, you all know the most effective strategy is the night before the election, and you know what I mean," I mean essentially calling for them to rally the Klan to eliminate black vote. Again, the country's in--under incredible stress because of these transitions going on.

Between forty-six and forty-eight at the presidential level, some more radical changes are happening. FDR had died in office already. Now Harry Truman is the President, and he's fighting for his political life. The Democratic Party's on the verge of being split. Recognizing that there's incredible dissension amongst the Democratic ranks, Southern Democrats are very unhappy with the trends in what's happening in the country, supported by the federal government, that entity that blacks saw as a place of salvation. Truman doesn't know what to do, and so he actually lets--he sort of throws a bone to his antagonists in the Democratic Party and lets Congress kill the FEPC. So now there's no more publicity campaign machine to sort of embarrass factories into employing African Americans and practicing non-discrimination policies. Truman lets Congress kill the FEPC but knows he needs the black vote to win election. It was clear when FDR got elected in 1944, it was clear that the black vote is what brought him, got him into office, and Truman can't lose it.

So Truman raises the stakes, after killing the FEPC, and appoints a distinguished panel to serve as the President's Commission on Civil Rights, which would recommend over time more adequate means and procedures for the protection of civil rights for U.S. citizens. In October Forty-Seven, it issues its, its report, called "To Secure These Rights," a landmark document. "To Secure These Rights" defined the nation's civil rights agenda for the next generation. The commission noted the many restrictions on blacks and urged that each person, regardless of race, color, or national origin, should have access to equal opportunity in securing education, decent housing, and jobs. Among its proposals, the commission suggested anti-lynching and anti-poll tax laws, a permanent FEPC, and strengthen--strengthening the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. The commission went much further than Southern Democrats ever imagined they would dare to go, further than Truman thought they would actually go. But he called this commission together and so he had to face a choice, what to do.

So in February of 1948, Truman rolls the dice and calls for the implementation of the Commission's recommendations. Southerners immediately threaten a filibuster and Truman, unable to secure support from Congress or action from Congress, moves ahead using executive authority. And among other things, he bolsters the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, appoints the first black judge to the federal bench, names several other blacks to high ranking administrative positions, and most important, on July 26th of 1948, he issued the executive order abolishing segregation in the armed forces and ordered full integration of all the services. The executive orders that grow out of this array of changes are 9980, nine-nine-eight-zero, establishing fair employment practices in the federal government, and the next one immediately, so you can see he's going on a tear, Executive Order 9981 establishes the President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Forces, the decree that leads to the desegregation order to the military. Now it's the order. The military takes its sweet old time desegregating, but the order's issued in 1948, growing out of this--Truman's political move to sort of clarify the mess of the Democratic Party, make it known to African Americans that he was going to support them, the Democratic Party would support them.

But was it enough?  Henry Wallace, who had been a former Vice President of FDR, before he got booted, very progressive and challenges Truman from the left. The real challenge comes from the right, within the Democratic Party, let me be clear. Truman's support for a strong civil rights platform for the Democratic, Democratic convention that was coming up is opposed by conservative Democrats. And they say, "If you bring this platform to the convention floor, we will leave."  Truman brought the platform to the convention floor and conservative Democrats from Southern states bolt and form what is popularly known as the Dixiecrat Party, with Strom Thurmond as its presidential candidate. The Democratic Party is split and it's quite unclear what's going to happen. Now, what happens is that Truman wins by a hair's breath, and again, without black support, he never would have been elected to a full term as President.
Chapter 6. Legal Transformations in the 1940s: Brown v. Board of Education [00:28:29]

Now that¡¯s what¡¯s happening on sort of the high political stage throughout the 1940s. Let me quickly canvass what's happening, it's still politics of course, but in the legal arena, over this period, to help you understand another element of this, of this shift that's happening in the country on these issues. And what I want to give you is the legal history of Brown v. Board of Education. That's where this is heading up to. The legal history begins at Howard University Law School. I already mentioned before the National--the New Negro Alliance, excuse me, formed in 1933, relied upon law school students and law professors at Howard University Law School to argue its case that eventually becomes a Supreme Court decision in 1930--I forgot my notes. I'll just guess thirty-seven, I'm blanking right now. But the battle begins at Howard University Law School. Excuse me, I've lost track for a second. There we go.

Charles Houston, the attorney who also spearheads its citizens campaign for Marian Anderson's concert, he's brought in to head up the law school in the late-1920s, to bring it up to fully accredited status. He starts hiring professors of law. Some of the great legal jurists of the next twenty and thirty years, forty years would actually start at Howard University Law School as professors, and they would train that first cadre of civil rights attorneys. In fact, the first civil rights law class in the country was taught at Howard during this period. The most famous student during the period, this, this early-1930s, is Thurgood Marshall. Thurgood Marshall, a native of Maryland, wanted to go to the University of Maryland School of Law, but by practice, blacks were not admitted, so he had to go to--he ended up going to Howard University. And at that very small law school with some very intense faculty, he goes through sort of a boot camp for several years, and comes out with the kind of legalized training, with special attention to civil rights cases.

Marshall scores his first major court victory along these lines in 1935, in a case called Murray versus Pearson. In this case, a guy named Donald Murray was not allowed to enter the University of Maryland because he was black. Raymond Pearson, the president of the University of Maryland--so it's the student versus the president as far as naming conventions, Murray versus Pearson--said that Murray could obtain separate but equal training at the Princess Anne Academy, also in the state of Maryland. However, the Princess Anne Academy did not offer a legal degree, which is what Murray was actually trying to obtain. Making a long story short, Marshall and his mentor, now increasingly colleague, Charles Houston, who's now the head of the Legal Defense Fund at NAACP, argue the case up to the Supreme Court. And the court declares that the University of Maryland, because it did not have a separate and equal facility for teaching law, had to let Murray in. Okay, that's 1935.

Based on the success of that case, Houston brings Marshall over to the NAACP and they start traveling from southern courthouse to a southern courthouse to southern courthouse, filing law--lawsuits for black students and teachers. In 1938, in the case--these are Supreme Court cases by the way--Gaines v. Canada. Lloyd Gaines is the plaintiff and Canada¡ªwho is, I'm missing the first name here, It's the last name of the registrar of the University of Missouri. So the case is called Gaines v. Canada. It's a student versus the registrar of the University of Missouri. The University of Missouri refused to admit Lloyd Gaines, African American, to its law school because the school was only for whites. It was common in Missouri for the state to send black students to neighboring states for courses of study not offered by Missouri's black schools. Since Missouri did not have a separate but equal law school for blacks, the Supreme Court declares that Gaines had to be allowed to attend the University of Missouri Law School.

So you have in Murray v. Pearson, there's no separate institution offering a law degree in Maryland, so you have to let, admit Murray into the school of law. In Gaines v. Canada, University of Missouri, the idea of shipping a student out of state--which was not just a Missouri practice by the way. A lot of southern students--states did this--was ruled unconstitutional. The state had to provide state-funded separate but equal legal facility. Now, I mean, one might ask, why¡¯s, why would a state even, you know, provide these fellowships, scholarships to get the students educated in law school if not in their own state?  The thinking was, you got them out of the state, they would stay out of the state. So the south was trying to export black legal, potential legal talent to northern places mainly. To get that "problem" out of their state, they'd pay for them to leave. The Supreme Court says, "Can't do it."  That's 1938, if I didn't mention that.

Houston and Marshall keep plugging away, filing the lawsuits, poking at the system. In 1946, they take on the case of a woman named Ada Sipuel. In forty-six, Sipuel had applied to the University of Oklahoma Law School and was denied because of race. And in 1948, the Supreme Court finally rules that Oklahoma had to provide instruction for blacks equal to that of whites. So this is now--not following¡ªthey¡¯re not breaking new ground here. They're following a precedent that was there in the Donald v. Murray, bounded by Gaines v. Canada, say you can't ship her out some place else. So Oklahoma says, "All right, well we're going to comply. We're not going to admit her to our law school, to the white law school. We'll build a law school for her."  And so in a few months' time the state of Oklahoma creates the Langston University School of Law, located at the state capital, thus requiring further litigation to demonstrate that the law school was inferior to the University of Oklahoma's law school.

I mean, the lawyers were, were claiming, "You cannot build a law school in a few months," and it really was just done in a few months, "designed to educate blacks in the state and suggest that it's even near equal to what the University of Oklahoma's already established law school provides."  They don't have the resources, they don't have the access, they don't have the training available to them. So further litigation ensues and in 1949, Oklahoma, the University of Oklahoma decides to admit Sipuel, thus breaking the color line for the School of Law there. Sipuel becomes not just the first black woman, or black, to integrate in the University of Oklahom--Oklahoma Law School, she's the first black woman to attend an all-white law school in the entire South. The law school admits here and gives her a special chair. That's nice, it seems, right?  Well, the chair is marked "colored" and it's roped off from the rest of the class. She's in the same classroom but in a roped off section of one.

Now as it happens, her classmates and teachers actually welcome her into the classroom. The resistance is coming from someplace else, institutionally or governmentally. Stories abound, and Sipuel is¡ªwould, would support this, that students shared their notes with her, studied with her, helped her catch up on material if she happened to miss some of it. Sipuel had to eat in a separate section of the, of a separate and chained off and guarded section in the law school cafeteria, and white students would crawl under the chain and eat with her when the guards weren't around. Her law student tuition are supported by hundreds of small donations and, she would recount later, she believed she owed it to all those who supported her that she had to ser¡ªthat she had to make it. Now actually, if you look up on the website, and I imagine one or two might do it right now, even though I hope you don't, the University of Oklahom--Oklahoma Law School is named for Ada Sipuel now. This is also a generational change of another kind of order.

In any event, the important thing about all these different cases, these three sort of landmark cases, they shared some things in common. They're all about law schools. They're all about law schools. Marshall and Houston believed that they had to find test cases that would create the greatest chance of sympathy from judges and eventually Supreme Court justices. And so they thought by bringing to their attention, to the judges' attention, people who wanted to be like them, study the law, and people who--and this is important, and I'll speak more about it on Monday--who were astonishingly good students. They had to be perfect students. By bringing incredible students in front of them who are trying to become lawyers, these judges might be, you know, have thought, "Well, gosh, this really is a silly system. We need to find some other way, other way around it."  So that's one part about it. It's just about, it¡¯s just about access to law schools.

Now what it's also, and probably even more important--not even probably--definitely more important about these law school, these cases, these legal cases, is that none of them challenged Plessy v. Ferguson. All of them are articulated upon the grounds of, there is no separate but equal, equal institution for these black plaintiffs to attend. In Maryland, in Missouri, in Oklahoma, in each of those cases, they're saying there's no separate but equal institution. Oklahoma tried making one. It wasn't equal enough. It was separate but not equal. So these--this is a nice and slow and gentle, I mean according to them, approach to try to break down segregation in higher education. Based on the success they're meeting with the law schools, they start going after graduate schools.

So professional schools into graduate schools, and then they start--I mean, and basically the writing is now on the wall. People see this. They realize the trajectory of these attorneys is heading sort of downward in a sense, hierarchically, and the next battle field is going to be secondary and primary schools. Southern states recognize this and feverishly start trying to improve black schools, which were horrible. I mean the, the statistics are kind of shocking about how poorly funded these schools were, you know, only used textbooks, no transportation. Southern states try--start trying pouring, pouring money into these schools, trying to improve them, so they could actually survive a test of separate but equal. But they're so bad, they can't catch up.

So the attorneys, NAACP attorneys, start focusing now on elementary and secondary schools and challenging the very principle of segregation in education¡ªthat seg--that segregation on racial lines was unconstitutional. They, as they're going around setting up these test cases, there are five cases all happening at the same time that rise to the Supreme Court's attention, and the Supreme--Supreme Court bundles them together. There are cases in South Carolina, Virginia, Kansas, Delaware, and the District of Columbia. They bundle them together under Brown, the father of two girls integrating--trying to integrate schools in Topeka, Kansas. But that¡¯s--this is one case representing many other cases. The attorney general of the United States actually calls for the end of segregation, but the reasoning is revealing. He wrote that,

"Racial discrimination furnishes grist for the Communist propaganda mills and it raises doubt even among friendly nations as to the intensity of our devotion to the Democratic faith."

He's not talking about, "Hey, we need to educate our citizens."  It's like, "This looks bad on the international scene. It's embarrassing and it's, it¡¯s affecting negatively our potential to make change around the world."  Cutting to the chase, Brown versus the Board of Education makes it to the Supreme Court, and the ruling is offered in May of 1954. Earl Warren, the very new Chief Justice, writes the opinion for a unanimous court that says,

"The separate educational facilities is in--inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought up (brought, I mean, this is the bundling) are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment."

Separation of the races and facilities is inherently unequal, based on equal protection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. Now, very quickly, a few words about Earl Warren himself because it's actually fascinating. He¡¯s a¡ªwhile the, while these cases are being bundled and brought up through the, the system, he's not the Chief Justice. He¡¯s appointed that position--He's not even on the Supreme Court. He's appointed to that position after the Chief Justice, Fred Vincent, dies. Someone, jurists, legal, legal historians think it was probably going to go against Brown. Eisenhower, now the President of the United States, appoints what others thought a mere politician to the Supreme Court, thus angering other associate justices who thought they were going to be the next Chief Justice. And Warren would actually go on to become a great mediator on the court, using his political skills. And becomes on-- becomes a great civil rights jurist, someone Eisenhower would call "the greatest mistake of his presidency," appointing Warren to the Supreme Court.

Now Warren himself did not have a sterling civil liberties record. In fact, it was pretty horrible. When he was the attorney general of California in 1942, he led the move to detain and then inter Japanese Americans. And as he told a conference of his fellow governors in 1943, his first year as governor of California,

"If the Japs are released, no one will be able to tell the saboteur from any other Jap. We're now producing approximately half of the ships and airplanes of the country on the Pacific Coast. To cripple these industries or the facilities that serve them would be a bloody--a body blow to the war effort. We don't want to have a second Pearl Harbor in California. We don't propose to have the Japs back in California during this war if there is any lawful means of preventing it."

This is one of the great civil rights justices speaking before he was elevated to that position. So people doing some basic psychoanalysis, armchair psychoanalysis, saying Warren is trying--I mean is horrified in retrospect over what he did in a moment of war, what he felt was right at the time, to deny citizenship rights to so many people, and was trying to sort of cleanse himself. Now there's much more to be said about Brown v. Board of Education, the legal court case. But this part is important to know, in the sense that Warren comes in out of the blue. It probably changes the future of the decision. The, the--If you look at justices' opinions leading up to Brown, it seemed at best there might be a split in the court, if not a denial, but Warren said, "No, we are going to be active, essentially, and it must be unanimous," and he basically browbeat the associate justices to line up behind him to offer this ruling. A watershed moment, thus closing the door on the constitutionality of separate but equal, articulated in Plessy v. Ferguson at the end of the nineteenth century.

Now the Supreme Court says that this is unconstitutional, segregation in, in, in education, but how are you going to change it?  This is probably one of the most--This may be the most cruel but important part of Brown v. Board of Education, is that it's remanded back to local districts to figure out the best play--best way to desegregate the schools. South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi governors threaten to abolish public schools as a result. "We'll just close all the damn public schools," because the Supreme Court is only talking about public places of accommodation. A year after Brown is articulated, it comes back with what people call Brown II, when the Supreme Court sends these cases back to the local, local--sends the cases back to the courts of origins and in deference to local customs, and familiarity, says that these things should proceed with all deliberate speed. One of these wonderfully vague, damningly vague, Supreme Court edicts. All deliberate speed.

Many people thought, "like really quickly!"  Other people thought, "Let's deliberate for a long time."  Speed, after all, is really quite relative. There are many other immediate ramifications or responses to Brown v. Board and its ruling in 1954 and fifty-five. You--We began the lecture with one of them, with Anna, excuse me, Melba Beals as a young girl about to be raped, because the Supreme Court had enraged this white father, that it was going to change the way the world looked for him. We'll talk more about other ways of resistance and high political theater and Gothic violence in the wake of Brown v. Board when we pick up on Monday. Thank you.
Lecture 14 - From Sit-Ins to Civil Rights [March 1, 2010]
Chapter 1. Narratives of the Civil Rights Movement: Rosa Parks [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  A piece of course business. Just a reminder that the 4 Little Girls, Spike Lee's documentary about the, the, the, the murder of four girls in Birmingham, is going to be screened tonight at eight o'clock in WLH--

Student:  One-nineteen.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Thank you, one-nineteen. Tonight and tomorrow night. It is quite a powerful documentary until about the last five or six minutes, and then the wheels fall off, but that's like Spike Lee's films in general. The¡ªBut, in any event, you'll, you¡¯ll know what I'm talking about when it actually happens. The documentary itself is rather stunning. Now, okay, today's lecture, if you look at the online guide, is supposed to be about Martin Luther King, the establishment of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. And I'm going to do my absolute best to get us to that moment. We should be able to do it. But because of the lost lecture due to the midterm, this is sort of my last attempt to get us back on schedule. So I want to canvass a slightly larger period.

Today I plan on discussing some critical aspects of the Montgomery bus boycott and the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, events from fifty-four, excuse me, fifty-five, fifty-five, fifty-seven. By doing so, it allows me to talk about a very important aspect of the movement that I've made an allusion to already once or twice in the course, but you'll certainly see it coming up again--time and again over the next few weeks of the course, and that is the issue of respectability. Just as we can look at the late nineteenth century¡¯s--century and issues of, of being civilized, of having proper sort of normed middle class behaviors is very important to at least the black leadership elite class, being respectable, being the right kind of person is fundamental to understanding a lot of the civil rights struggles. Now let's look at the Montgomery bus boycott. And I'm going to presume that in the history of the Montgomery bus boycott and the desegregation of Central High School, this is now American History 101 that you should have had the gloss of it when you were in high school. And I'm sure you didn't get much more than the gloss, and I'm sure the gloss was wrong. [students laugh]  But what I want to do is actually give you--you know the mythic narrative of these things, which is there for a reason, and I want to give you some background details that are important to consider.

So as far as the boycott is concerned, Montgomery bus boycott, there's a standard history that has become mythic. Rose Parks, the tired seamstress, refuses to give up the seat, her seat, on the bus in Montgomery and she gets arrested. Martin Luther King comes swooping in to her rescue and then rises to the national scene with his leadership of the yearlong boycott, thirteen-month boycott, that would, that would ensue shortly thereafter. I was looking at the syllabus last night and realized I dropped a reading for you. And I want to encourage you to go back and look at it now. I'm referencing it right now. I believe it's pages three fifty-two to three sixty-one in the Manning Marable anthology. It just, I just, it just slipped out of the syllabus by accident. And in those pages, you'll see Jo Ann Gibson Robinson, a prominent black woman in Montgomery, explain her version of the events around the bus boycott. Just even knowing about Jo Ann Gibson Robinson changes the story of the bus boycott. Robinson was part of a cadre of, of middle-class African American women, sort of think of the club women from the early, late-nineteenth century that I talked about a few weeks ago, who had already organized into a force, the Women's Political Council. These were women who were well-educated, college educated, some of them teaching at a local college. These were sort of the elite. Although they didn¡¯t ness--they weren't rolling in money, these were the elite in, in black Montgomery.

The Women's Political Council with Jo Ann Gibson Robinson's leadership, she's one of the key figures in it, has already gone to the black ministers in town and the city government in town about their frustration over the way that blacks were treated on the buses and the way they were treated in stores downtown. "Economic boycott" are the words they're floating around. They wanted to try to develop the courage in the black community to get a boycott organized. The Women's Political Council keeps running into dead ends in various places. They might get a meeting, but the meeting, frankly, where men were in a leadership position, would be rather condescending to the women: "That's very sweet of you to come in, but , you know, we'll take care of things now."  Nothing would happen.

Now the Women's Political Council actually tries to organize boycotts of the buses around issues of crisis, and this is when other people get arrested for refusing to give up their seat. Now if you look at the selection in the Marable reading and Jo Ann Gibson Robinson's recounting of the bus boycott and Rosa Parks arrest, you might find something striking. When I was actually going back and looking at it tonight, like, "God, how did I forget to include this?"  If you scan it, as I did several times, for Martin Luther King's role, you will only see King's name mentioned once and, quite literally, in the second to last line, I believe, of this reading. Now this is an excerpt, granted. Things might have been dropped out. But if nothing else, metaphorically, it's actually a very important point. King was not there, not engaged in the organizing moment, early organizing moments of the bus boycott, what would turn into the bus boycott.

Now why bother telling this story?  Just because it's inserting a new cast of characters?  Well, maybe that's part of it. Maybe because it was pointing to the role that women played in the movement, had always played in the movement. That's certainly part of it as well. But another part of it's important to know, is that the bus boycott was, its success was incumbent upon many different factors. It wasn't just King's charisma, although we cannot ever discount King's charisma. Part of it was dealing with an already established and organized, politically organized, black middle-class, as basically the organizing is done through their women. There's already then a network of activists in place, upon which King's charisma could be displayed, or through which. I don't know what the right descriptor is. It basically starts to muddy up the narrative of the Civil Rights Movement, this, this amazing moment of the movement. But there's more to the story, always, more complicating factors.

Rosa Parks was arrested, there's not doubt about that, but it wasn't as spontaneous as history makes it out to be. Now Parks is refer--referred to as the mother of the movement, partly because of her indisputable character. She was as proper as one could imagine. She was hardworking, she was civil, she was law-abiding. She's the perfect person to become a "victim," of it were, of an insane system. If you can't treat this person properly, there's something fundamentally wrong with your system. We know that about Rosa Parks. But what we don't know is that she'd been trained at a civil rights institute the summer before she decides to get arrested, the Highlander School in Tennessee. Parks was reluctant to go, but she had friends who were already committed to the movement in very public ways, convinced her to come along. And while there, she's meeting with white radicals, labor activists, Communist Party members, other black activists from around the country, and learning about nonviolent civil disobedience, learning about different strategies in which to create a crisis for the sake of the greater good. So Rosa Parks, now she's not a fire breathing radical. She's not at the vanguard, but she is trained and she's prepared for that moment when it actually happens. That's dropped out of the history.

Another thing that's dropped out of the history is, she was not the first woman--or person, but in this case, woman-- to be arrested for, you know, violating etiquette on the buses, certainly not in Montgomery, certainly not in other places. In fact, a few weeks before Parks was arrested, a young woman named Claudette Colvin was arrested in a similar situation. The boycott almost emerged, organized by the Women's Political Council, and the boycott almost emerged revolving around Colvin's arrest. She was a straight A student; she seemed to be of impeccable character. If you're treating a child like this, how could you treat any--I mean how could you claim to be humane?  It turns out though, that very quickly discovered that they couldn't use her, Colvin, as a vehicle for their boycott, because this straight A student of unimpeachable character, unmarried of course, also happened to be pregnant. She was not showing at the moment. People in Montgomery, black activists, realized right away there's no case. That they, they cannot make a case around her because of Southern traditions that would say that she was immoral for her, quote, "condition."  And that would have been the word that would have been used. And they knew that they could not make a convincing case if they have someone with such failed standards, such immorality in her system, that she'd be the worst example for these women activists. The activists understood that being respectable in a very narrow band of what that means was absolutely critical.

Respectability is so important to the movement, because anything that transgressed a line of being respectable could be used to justify a denial of some sort, whether it's legal, "You can't come to this school," whether it's psychological, "I can, I can limit your entire existence in terms of possibilities," or whether it's physical, "I can kill you."  Let's just go back to Brown v. Board and the reactions to it. I already told you about Melba Beals' experience as she's about to be raped when she's twelve years old, but we can see in reactions in other places in the South, systemic reactions, the extent or the ways in which there was a logic that blacks had to behave just right because the stakes were so high. In the wake of Brown v. Board, in July of Fifty-Four, the White Citizens Council is formed. I'm simplifying a lot, but think of it as the upper crust Ku Klux Klan. Business leaders, white males, prominent figures in these Southern towns that organized, Southern cities, organized themselves, fund Klan activities, making sure in a variety of ways that there would not be an integration or destruction of their social order.


Chapter 2. Narratives of the Civil Rights Movement: Emmett Till [00:10:57]

Economic warfare happens across the South with, with city leaders, white coun--white citizens councils battling it out with radicals, the most proper radicals, like Jo--Jo Ann Gibson Robinson. Governments start responding. This arcane little caveat in, in--excuse me, loss of words here--in how governments interact, the doctrine of interposition. It's a weird phrase. The doctrine of interposition is invoked by Southerners, saying that the federal government had no power to interfere in states. This goes back to 1832 or something like that. Completely ignored little tidbit attached on some bill somewhere. Southern governors and governments start invoking the doctrine of interposition, saying the federal government had no power to interfere, interfere in states. Federal officials from the South, members of the House of Representatives and Senate, gather together and all through the Southern manifesto, saying that Brown was a clear abuse of judicial power. Only one member from a federal delegation in the South refused to participate, and that's Al Gore, Sr. from Tennessee. Wait, I might be blanking on that. I think--

Student:  Kefauver

Professor Jonathan Holloway: Kefauver, yeah, thank you.

Student: and Linden Johnson.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Was it three?

Student:  It was three.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Well, there you go, it was three. Well done. Where¡¯d you learn this history?   Did you take this class last year?

Student:  No, I just wrote a paper on postwar America.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Excellent. Well done. You were trained by somebody well. Anyway, but thank you. There was--All but three of I think maybe a hundred people.

Student:  No, there were representatives who didn¡¯t do it, including Rayburn

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Oh, well hell, apparently I don't know the history at all.

Student:  There were other representatives.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  This is why it's so dangerous to talk to students at Yale. The fact is massive--the Southern Manifesto is a declaration that Brown doesn't carry weight. There's going to be a negative response of, of, of resistance, and the phrase becomes known as massive resistance; that the South is going to refuse to proceed forward with the logic coming down from the Supreme Court. People start becoming targeted. NAACP as an organization becomes targeted by Southern legislatures, saying the NAACP had to reveal its membership list in order to stay in business as a, as a, an organization, had to reveal who was in its membership. This is basically a death warrant to the organization in some states, and to people who were, and to people who were members. If you were known to be a member of the NAACP and worked in Mississippi, well, you know, the boss might decide you don't have your job any longer, for some other trumped up reason. And it might actually get you killed. Violence takes on gothic proportions in Mississippi more than any other place. In fifty-five, several black leaders urging blacks to vote were murdered, one on the local courthouse lawn. The president of a local NAACP chapter was shot down when he ignored the order to remove his name from the voting register.

And then of course there was Emmett Till, fourteen year old, fourteen-year old boy, sent from Chicago to stay with his family in Mississippi. There are many different versions of what happens. The allegation is that he whistled one day, hanging out with his cousins, that he whistled at the--a white storekeeper's wife when she walked past. Others have countered saying he had a, he had a stutter, and, you know, he would often lisp as a result. What actually happened at that moment is really inconsequential. What happens later is of great consequence. That night he's abducted. He's beaten. One of his eyes is gouged out. He's wrapped in barbed wire and tied to farm equipment before being thrown over a bridge. When they find him, his body is sent surreptitiously up to Chicago. His mother insists on having an open casket at the Chicago funeral and the images shock the country. There's a clip here, that opens up with Mose Wright, who was Emmett Till's uncle, who makes a very famous declaration going into court. And he points out the people who came to get Emmett Till from him, which meant he could no longer live in Mississippi. He vacated right away in order that he might live to see another day.

[Mose Wright:] When the sheriff came and told me they had found a body at Pillow... [indecipherable] and wanted me to go and identify the body, which I did. And we found the body, which it didn't have on any clothes at all. The body was so badly damaged that we couldn't hardly just tell who he was, but he happened to have on a ring with his initials, and that cleared it up.

[Narrator:] The body was shipped home, back north to Chicago where Mamie Till Bradley insisted on an open casket funeral, "So all the world can see," she said, "what they did to my boy."

[singing]

[Narrator:] Jet magazine showed Till's corpse, beaten, mutilated, shot through the head. A generation of black people would remember the horror of that photo.

[Mamie Till Bradley:] I believe that the whole United States is mourning with me, and that the death of my son can mean something to the other unfortunate people all over the world. Then for him to have died a hero would mean more to me than for him just to have died.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  When you heard the narrator, Julian Bond, talking about a generation would never forget this murder and the image that appeared in Jet magazine, he wasn't exaggerating. One of my former colleagues, her father's family from, was from Louisiana, from a rural part of Louisiana, and I was--he was visiting. We were having lunch together, dinner together, and Emmett Till came up. I can't remember why. But he said he was fourteen or fifteen years old when Emmett Till was murdered, and he knew then that he had to leave the South as soon as he could, and in fact, he never went back. And he said he has never forgotten, and he knew there was no hope for, as he put it, "a black man in the deep South."  Now there was a court case. It was an all-white, all male jury. The jury deliberates for sixty-seven minutes. One juror said later, it wouldn't have taken so long if they hadn't stopped to get a soda. And the jury defines--finds the defendants not guilty, although everybody knew who did it.

January Fifty-Six, one month after Parks' arrest in Montgomery, Look magazine publishes an interview of the Till defendants in which they state for the record that they had in fact killed him. Now this is the most spectacular and perhaps egregious case of violence gone unpunished, but there were other episodes, and some of them happened as a direct result of Brown. I already again related to you, the attempted rape of Melba Beals, but violence is endemic. In fact, this is one of the great stories of the nonviolent civil rights movement, is that it was horribly violent and it's rather shocking that it did not become more violent at any given moment.


Chapter 3. Narratives of the Civil Rights Movement: The Little Rock Nine [00:20:09]

Now thinking of violence and respectability and narratives of the Civil Rights Movement leads us to the Little Rock Nine. And I have to gloss over the history very quickly for the sake of time. Melba Beals goes on--the person who was twelve years old when someone loses his mind and tries to attack her--goes on to come--become one of nine teenagers who are eventually selected by NAACP activists to integrate Little Rock Central High School.

They are focusing on Arkansas because it seemed to be one of the most progressive states in the South on these issues. Other parts--other school systems in Arkansas had actually already integrated, but Central was the most important, most visible high school in the state. The nine who were selected were amazing students, academically gifted, coming from the right families who comported themselves in the right way. Otherwise they would never have been selected. Without going over too much of the famous integration of Central High, I'll point out a few things that are, that one needs to remember. The students are selected to integrate in fifty-seven. There's fierce local resistance. The governor, Orval Faubus, calls in the Arkansas National Guard to prevent integration. President Eisenhower, very unhappy about the whole scene, sends in the one hundred and first Airborne to force the issue, and he does it not because he believed in integration, but because he believed in the federal government's right to assert itself. This is a states' rights versus federal rights issue for Eisenhower.

The troops ushered in the students after they had already tried to integrate the school before, but were harassed by mobs outside of the building. The students¡ªthe, the troops could go with the students up to the, the door of the classroom, but in the classroom, or in the bathroom, or in the cafeteria, all hell broke loose. One student had lye thrown in her face, almost permanently blinded. Students would talk like being in the bathroom, and then going to the bathroom, and then paper towels lit on fire being thrown overhead when they were helpless. They were attacked, books were thrown down, food poured on them, but they could not respond. The one student who did respond got kicked out, at which point they said, "One nigger down; eight more to go," trying to get these students out of the school. Houses were bombed, people were shot--shot at, folks lost their jobs. Now think about all this. What is it that's being asked of these children? And they are children.

Going back to Melba Beals, there's a few items from her diary entry, New Year's Day in 1958, that allow us to ask some pretty important questions. Four different items, selected from a longer list is, one, "to behave in a way that pleases Mother and Grandma," two people who were very central in her life. "To keep faith and understand more of how Gandhi behaved when his life was really hard; to pray daily for the strength not to fight back."  And the entry that, the resolution that she, that she put as number one, was to "do my best to stay alive until May twenty-nineth," the end of the school year. I mean, think about it: NAACP activists, grown women and men, are making sure the children stay--are to stay in school, despite the violence being vet--being visited upon them. And it's very fair to ask, is it appropriate for sixteen year olds to feel the need to write in their diaries that the most important New Year's resolution is to "do my best to stay alive" until the end of the school year?   What are the adults asking the children to do for the sake of the movement?  It's a case--it's a question that would come up quite angrily in 1963 in the Birmingham crisis.

Now one final note about the school year and Little Rock. What we don't often hear about, what we basically never hear about Central High School history, is that the govern--I mean, because it's a triumphant moment, right?  So the governor was so upset about the public relations disaster that accompanied the school's integration, that he decided to shut down Little Rock public schools the following year. The integration of the school, this great moment of civil rights victory of American exceptionalism, lasted one year, and the public schools were shut down. Why don't we know this part of the history?  You know, there's something really maybe too tantalizing about these nice narratives of our past. We can be ashamed of the shortcomings of our predecessors, but by keeping the story clean and simple, we can also be proud that our predecessors ultimately made the right decision and did the right things. In short, the Civil Rights Movement has been sanitized, because it ultimately casts a great light on the American character; that, you know, the American character can take its lumps, learn from its mistakes and then do great things. The Civil Rights Movement has been cast as a great moment of American exceptionalism when we all summoned the courage to do the right things, regardless of our political positions, where we are in the country, etcetera. Well, that's just one big fat lie. Only a minority of folks rose to the challenge, and accepted it, and pursued it.


Chapter 4. Narratives of the Civil Rights Movement: Martin Luther King, Jr [00:26:09]

Martin Luther--Martin Luther King's history is a case in point as far as rising to a challenge, and as far as what happens when a history is sanitized profoundly. King is raised in a tradition of ministers. His father and grandfather run the most elite black church in Atlanta. King has a rather raucous adolescence and college years. He and his buddy go around trying to run competitions about, you know, who could "deflower the most girls" in the language of the day. He does receive a religious--religious calling, however, goes off to seminary and then gets a PhD at Boston University, a PhD which scholars discovered, much to their great disappointment, about two decades ago, that he had plagiarized parts of it. King, though, these things aren't widely known at this moment in time, fifty-five, is seen as a real future star, and he gets a job in Montgomery, heading the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, which is, much in the tradition of his father and grandfather, the most elite, sort of upstanding and politically conservative, quiescent church, in that particular city. He's relatively newly married. He and his wife Coretta have a newborn. He wants to settle into a nice, quiet pulpit and do nice, quiet work.

Well, there's already things shifting around on the ground, with the Women's Political Council agitating for an economic boycott, trying to find a test case to boycott the buses. And the group of black ministers in town are very important people, and a group called the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance. A ton of syllables there. The Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance is feeling pressure from Women's Political Council to do something. King as a minister is automatically in that group. And then as things start heating up towards what will become Rosa Parks's moment, King is thrust into the limelight in a way he never wanted. Parks gets arrested. King is sent as an emissary or sacrificial lamb--really more of the latter. The Montgomery Improvement Association is formed. This is going to be the group that's going to organize the boycotts. King does not want to lead it. The other ministers, who are deeply skeptical this thing will actually work, figure, "King just got here. He's young; he'll rebound when this thing blows apart. We'll put him out front."  King couldn't say no. He fought, fought, fought, but he couldn't say no. He'd already resisted the invitation to head the local NAACP for the sake of his children¡¯s, his child's safety.

Anyway, on December fifth, the night before the boycott's set to begin, King is still resisting the urging of the ministers, and finally relents, and writes out some notes on a piece of paper. Goes to the pulpit with about ten, fifteen minutes to prepare and says, in part, the following. Now the audio is, is not great, and I'll tell you what he says, but I want you to hear the energy of the moment during the closing moments of his, of his speech.

[Martin Luther King, Jr.:]  And we are not wrong; we are not wrong in what we are doing. If we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the Constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong. If we are wrong, Jesus of Nazareth was merely a utopian dreamer that never came down to Earth. If we are wrong, justice is a lie, love has no meaning. And we are determined here in Montgomery to work and fight until justice runs down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  [music starts playing] Oops! "If we are wrong," he says--

"And, and we are not wrong in what we are doing. We are not wrong. If we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the Constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong. If we are wrong, Jesus of Nazareth is, was mer--merely a utopian dreamer that never came down to Earth. If we are wrong, justice is a lie, love has no meaning. And we are determined here in Montgomery to work and fight until justice runs down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream."

You can tell, the audience is going crazy, energized by this young man who's come out of nowhere. But think about what he's saying here. He invokes God and Jesus. It's what, what one would expect of course, but he invokes in the first part of this quote the Supreme Court and the Constitution. He's evoking law. King is not invoking anything radical, as a matter of fact. He's invoking the Supreme Court and the Constitution. He's invoking those very things that made citizens citizens in the United States after all, and perhaps that is the thing that made him so radical. Anyway, the movement takes off and the boycott holds together. It's a, it¡¯s a remarkable history, although it wasn't the first boycott, bus boycott. The movement holds together for thirteen months before the Supreme Court forces the integration of the, of the buses. These are the same thirteen months when massive resistance is rising up throughout the South, the same thirteen months when Emmett Till is murdered, and the same thirteen months when the strategy for Little Rock becomes articulated and starts to gain traction. A period of astonishing change.

Now King rises to prominence. He's traveling all around the country constantly raising money during the bus boycott. They need resources and money to pay for gasoline and cars that are all shipped down to Montgomery to make this thing work. But he's not doing it by himself. He's aided by two people who are rather important. One is Bayard Rustin, who I've already mentioned before. Earlier part in his life, member of the Young Communist League, a draft resistor, someone who was arrested on morals charges for being caught in the back seat of a car with another man. He's gay. Often recognized as one of the great organizing minds of the freedom struggles and labor struggles of the twentieth century, but because of the politics of the day, hampered by his sexuality and, and by his communist past. But Bayard Rustin is in King's corner, you know, telling him, "Do this, do that. You know, follow this particular path."  King is also aided by Ella Baker. And by the way, Rustin and Baker are finally getting the attention that they deserve from, from amazing histories that have been written about five or six years ago. Ella Baker, a long time activist who worked for unemployment councils in the Great Depression. Certainly was affiliating with folks who were communist. Older woman who becomes hailed by a younger generation of activists who are just about to become known for being one of the most important leaders in the movement. Baker starts to work with King and advising him as well. I'll come back to them in a moment.

As the boycott nears success, we see violence quite clearly. King's house is bombed. Other people are being shot at. It's a bloody mess. But Rustin sees in the success and the violence as a catalytic, catalytic moment of possibility, and that the question becomes not so much, "How great was this moment?" but, "What can we do to capitalize upon it?  What can we do to sustain this organizing energy?  There needs to be an organization."  And he calls on King to bring together other leaders, and, and essentially religious leaders, to gather together to think of the next steps. And out of that comes the Southern Leadership Conference, is what the plan is at least. The Southern Leadership Conference, bringing together, you know, the great leaders in the South, African American, to become organized to have sustained change. Well, King makes a decision that infuriates Rustin, and they have a very tense relationship in general, Rustin recognizing King's astonishing gifts as a speaker and King recognizing Rustin's astonishing gifts as an organizer and political thinker.

King never likes the fact that Rustin is gay and talks condescendingly to Rustin about it. Rustin always underestimates, in King's opinion, the role of religion in this movement. So Rustin calls it the Southern Leadership Conference, and King changes its name under, with sort of fiat, to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. And the SCLC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, becomes one of the most important civil rights organizations for the next, really for the next twenty, thirty years. King's popularity skyrockets with the success of the bus boycott. He's increasingly drawn away from the pulpit as he travels about trying to raise consciousness and funds. And by January of 1960, having barely been in the pulpit at Dexter over the previous few years, he leaves. He's not ministering to that church. The SCLC, what he now heads--[student sneezes and he coughs] excuse me, bless you--the SCLC is now focusing on leadership training and citizenship education.

Now as the SC--SCLC emerges out of King's success, wrapped up in his charisma, it creates stress in the, in "the system."  You see stress often embodied in intergroup squabbling, something you'll see a lot throughout the 1960s. An established organization like the NAACP is not too thrilled about the SCLC arriving on the scene, because they're competing for the same people and the same dollars, scant dollars. In fact, Medgar Evers, who's the head of the Mississippi NAACP, who joins the SCLC, this new group, was told he had to choose. You either pick with SCLC or you pick the NAACP. He stays with the NAACP. Now the NAACP is already under stress. I talked about the fact that its rolls are being opened up by Southern legislatures, but there's also stress internally through people like Robert Williams, military vet from North Carolina, who becomes fed up with events in his town where he's the head of the local NAACP chapter, and calls for retaliatory violence. He's kicked out of the NAACP by the end of the 1950s. So the NAACP is struggling with rising, percolating spots of militancy, people leaving the, leaving, leaving the message behind at the NAACP. And now this new group appears on the scene that might pull away other supporters.

The important thing to know I guess from that, I suppose, is that neither the SCLC nor the NAACP had control over the movement. No single organization could claim they were the group that was running the movement. And while King is the most electrifying speaker of this great narrative, he hardly had any control over it. If you look to the events of February first of 1960, you can see the way in which there was a sort of wildcat mentality about many things happening in the movement. On that day, in Greensboro, North Carolina, four men, students of North Carolina A and T, black school, head to downtown Greensboro, not far away. They decide that they're gonna--sick and tired of the treatment they're receiving at the Woolworth's, the local five and dime, let me think, drugstore, convenience store. It's funny, when I began this course, I mean when I began teaching years ago, Woolworth's were still around. Ain't so much still around anymore, but the, but the history still is.

So the men go to the lunch counter and insist on being served. They could buy things other places in the store, but they couldn't be served at the lunch counter. The waitress says, " I can't, you know, I can't help you out." And they sit there, and they sit, and they sit, and they sit, taking up four seats at the lunch counter. It's a wildcat sit-in. It's not the first by any stretch. The March on Washington Movement had been organizing them for decades. Labor movements have been organizing them for decades. But this time it takes off. You have just the right mix of electricity, of anticipation, of possibility and frustration certainly. And you see across the country sit-ins by people your age, all across the South. Sixty cities become sites of sit-ins, and all of these sit-ins, the young men and women are well dressed and impeccably mannered. To do anything else would invite potential death.

Ella Baker, the person who's essentially running the SCLC--King's the head of it, but Ella Baker's running it, ministering it--taps into this energy and organizes a youth conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, in April. She's expecting sort of a modest turnout. Overwhelming turnout, and overwhelming energy. "We, the college age students of the day, need to do something. We are ready."  And out of that organization grows the Southern Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, otherwise known as SNCC. I said Southern, I'm sorry. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, otherwise known as SNCC. SNCC would never become the biggest of the great civil rights organizations, but more than any, any other organization, it becomes the barometer of an evolution, of the evolution of 1960s' ideology. And SNCC will be part of, of the narrative that I lay out over the next two and a half weeks of the course, because through them, you can actually see the changes, and really quite radical changes, in movement ideology during the 1960s.

But at its founding moment in April in 1960, SNCC is a group of college age individuals who espoused nonviolent ideology, who are absolutely interracial, and who wanted to be organized through a non-hierarchical system. They are, from the beginning, seen as a temporary organization, literally given a corner space in the offices of the SCLC headquarters. So it was operating under SCLC's umbrella, SCLC thinking, "This is a great way to get more youth involved in our movement."  You could even look back to the founding moment and see there's already some fissures in the relationship, if only because SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, is committed to a non-hierarchical organ--organizing logic. They, like Ella Baker, are a little bit nervous in the fact that SCLC is embodied in King, a magnificent man, but a far from perfect man, but only one man, and they wanted an organization that had many leaders. Now that's April 1960.

Heading into the fall, in October, King was arrested in Atlanta for violating, violating probation, on trumped up charges, and he's sentenced to four--I mean, I think it was a traffic violation. He's sentenced to four months hard labor. John F. Kennedy, who is campaigning for the presidency, calls Coretta Scott King and says that he will protect King. He actually had no way of protecting King, but in orchestrated phone calls, "I will do everything I can to protect your husband."  And with that, black support for Kennedy mushrooms. Kennedy goes on to win by a hundred and twenty thousand votes--still debates whether those votes actually existed or not--but he won by a hundred and twenty thousand votes, and it's clear that it's African American support, support that swung the election his direction. Blacks have in JFK the kind of leader at a symbolic and cultural level they have not had since FDR started making these gestures towards recognizing blacks' needs some twenty-five, thirty years earlier.

In 1961--I'm skipping a ton of details. I'm trying to get up to a moment of the most famous crisis--in 1961, CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality, as I mentioned in the last lecture, organizes a, a new round of freedom rides, getting on buses, integrated riders, and crossing state lines. Members of SNCC are on the bus as well. Students from Yale, from other places in Connecticut, jump on these buses and head on South. Once they cross into the deep South, the buses are attacked by smoke bombs, tires are slashed. As people run out of the buses to get away from the smoke, they're met by mobs who beat them with their fists, with metal poles. The buses are torched. Other buses are sent down. Eventually, the buses arrive down in Birmingham, Alabama, where Bull Connor, the Commissioner of Public Safety, knows they're coming, knows there's a mob waiting for them at the bus station, and does not offer police protection, and lets the students, the riders, get beaten senseless for fifteen minutes before letting the police come, before releasing the police. And people said, "Well, why did you do such a thing?"  He goes, "It was Mother's Day. You can't take a man away from his mother. You know, they needed to have time spent with their mother. You know, they would get there in time." 

There's a dawning at this moment, with this kind of violence and recalcitrance, of a militancy within SNCC and the beginnings of a move away from respectability. You start seeing different agendas being articulated within different organizations. The movement is going in fits and starts. Federations form and break apart. There's all kinds of infighting, and things seemed on the verge of collapse in Albany, Georgia, when they go to invoke another crisis. And in Albany, Georgia, where you have a confederation of different civil rights organizations coming together, to try to change that town, they're outsmarted by the white police. As the students try to start filling up the jails to create a crisis of overcrowding and, and get national sympathy, with the jail, no bail strategy "We'll let ourselves be in jail. We won't accept bail. They'll have to force us out. We won't have paid any bail. This will be great."  The police chief says, "We're going to keep our heads and start shuttling people out of jails to other jails." He doesn¡¯t react, essentially. Nothing happens. Everything fizzles, and there's a fear that this movement that began, quote, "began," in quotes, with Brown v. Board and has these violent reactions as you see it with Rosa Parks, and you see it with Emmett Till, and you see it in Central High School, the beginning of a new sort of vibrant youth organization, it feels like it's all going to collapse in Albany, Georgia, because the white officers realized, "If we don't react, this thing will go away."  Well, thank god for Bull Connor. I'll let the film tell you much of that story, but suffice it to say that Connor did more, through his brutality, to help win converts to the Civil Rights Movement, more than anybody else could have practically done. I'll pick up on that moment, on that fact, at the next lecture. Thank you.
Lecture 15 - From Sit-Ins to Civil Rights (continued) [March 3, 2010]
Chapter 1. Introduction [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  The song that, I imagine, for many of you needs no introduction, but for a few of you who may not be familiar with it, that's one of the great anthems of the Civil Rights Movement, "We Shall Overcome."  You're actually lucky, I'm a--in past years I've had the TAs get up and sing it with me, I've had the class get up and sing it. For some reason, I'm a--I'm, I¡¯m absolving all of us of that kind of performance. I play it here for reasons that will become much more clear later on in the lecture, but this is--this piece of music, "We Shall Overcome," is one of sort of the anthems of familiarity, of memory, about the movement, and for very good reasons. But as part of my larger project of trying to help us understand a different notion of what the movement was really all about, I want to throw the song out to your senses, leave it dangling there for a while, and come back and sort of reinterpret it as this lecture goes forward, as much as I'm reinterpreting the movement in many ways itself. Let me, with that caveat out there, that introduction, reading Fire Next Time, James Baldwin's quite important, quite famous book, I thought I would really begin the lecture with a couple of quotes from James Baldwin, from this really fantastic documentary film on James Baldwin called The Price of the Ticket. I'd encourage you all to see it at some point. It's quite astonishing. Baldwin says during this documentary--he's, it¡¯s a, it's archival footage. He's talking to, it looks like to me, to be something like an Oxford round table, or, or, or here like the Yale Political Union, something to that effect, clearly college-age students. And he declares to these students,

"...That it comes as quite a shock to discover that the country to which you pledge allegiance does not pledge allegiance to you. It comes as quite a shock to discover that when you are a child rooting for Gary Cooper to shoot all the Indians, that the Indians are you."

Gary Cooper, for those who don't know, it's a different generation, great cinematic hero, often played the good guy, you know cowboys and Indians. And he realizes, James Baldwin, as a little child, as he's rooting for Gary Cooper to kill all the Indians, he actually is the Indian. Later on in the same documentary, Baldwin talking to a studio audience, being interviewed by one of these talk shows. It's poetic. He really was poetic. He says,

"The day will come when you will trust you more than you do now (speaking to presumptively a white audience) and you will trust me more than you do now. We will trust each other. I do believe, I really do believe, in the new Jerusalem. I really do believe that we can all become better than we are. I know we can. But the price is enormous and people are not yet willing to pay it."


Chapter 2. Martin Luther King: "Letter from Birmingham Jail" [00:03:22]

Much of the 1960s is about people coming to terms with the fact of who they are in the American pantheon, the cowboys or the Indians, and also coming to terms with what the price of that ticket is going to be. Now I ended the last lecture talking about the potential failure of the movement in Albany, Georgia, when the white authorities outsmart the activists by not reacting. And then I mentioned, along comes Bull Connor, who as King would say later on, was the most important person for the success of the movement, because of the severity of his actions. Bull Connor's the Commissioner of Public Safety. I mean, I'll be skirting along this very quickly, since you watched the documentary, 4 Little Girls, and you know a lot of this, this history and saw some of the images as well. He's the Commissioner of Public Safety and he's running for mayor. The election becomes, I'll just say, fraught with complication. There's already incredible tensions in, in Birmingham over issues that were similar to Montgomery in terms of who could shop in what stores, and in fact, on the ground in Birmingham, store owners were very willing at this point, because of the threat of economic warfare with the, with the black buying population, very willing to integrate the stores, but Bull Connor says no. And Connor is essentially running, running the city. So things are brought to a head.

King, who's not in Birmingham, is asked to come by the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, who is the head of a civil rights--sort of organizing civil rights activism in Birmingham, through a group called the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. It is essentially the NAACP. I mentioned in the last lecture that NAACP's books would be opened up by, by state governments, which would be essentially a threat to lose jobs and to, and to be harassed, to even be killed. Other organization--organizations spring up to replace the NAACP. In this case, it's the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Shuttlesworth calls King to Birmingham, knowing that King more than anybody else has the ability to electrify a population, and frankly to antagonize a population as well. Birmingham had already been the witness or home to all kinds of violence. Between fifty-seven and sixty-three, it had earned its nickname of "Bombingham."  There were eighteen unsolved bombings in the city in, in black neighborhoods, excuse me. City parks had been closed in 1962. Playgrounds, and pools, and golf courses had gone private. All these actions to prevent the gathering of people, activists, black people, and also to prevent an attempt to force the integration of public spaces. So playgrounds, golf courses, and pools go private. City on edge.

King comes to Birmingham and willfully gets arrested. He knows he's going to get arrested. He's trying to brew up crisis. But unlike the police in Albany, Georgia, who just, you know, relaxed and let things go and stayed in touch with everybody, Birmingham has not evolved that way in the police force. They throw King into solitary. There's no word coming from him. This is actually terrifying. This is an era when people would disappear, and King being such a high profile person was not protected from disappearing. Coretta Scott King is frantic, wanting to at least get reassurances that her husband's alive, not just safe but alive. [coughs] Excuse me. John F. Kennedy is currently the President, been elected, and he gets involved, much like he did when he was the candidate for the presidency, and seeks guarantees of King's safety and that he's treated well. While King is in jail, a number of clergy in Birmingham, white clergy, moderates, are basically upset that King is coming in from out of town, out of the blue, and is antagonizing the situation, stirring up trouble, and essentially is telling--publish--they publish a newspaper ad and basically telling King to slow things down, to calm down, to, to lower the temperature.

King responds by writing one of the great protest documents and letters, and that's the Letter from Birmingham Jail. Now the Letter from Birmingham Jail is not in your reader but, you know, it's online. I hope you've actually already looked at it. It's not in your reader because the King estate is rather protective of King's legacy and how much people are going to pay to have his words published. I'm being extremely politic in saying this. But the document is one of the most important documents in American protest history. One of the most frequently quoted passages is one I shall now quote as well. It brings together King's passion, of course, his eloquence, but also humanizes this in a way that connected with many people. This was an, an immediate sensation. King is responding to these, these ministers and says,

"We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jet-like speed toward gaining political independence, but we stiff creep at horse-and-buggy pace--still creep at horse-and-buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging dark--darts of segregation to say, 'Wait.' But you--when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son who is asking: 'Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?'; when you take a cross-county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading 'white' and 'colored'; when your first name becomes 'nigger,' your middle name becomes 'boy' however old you are, and your last name becomes 'John,' and your wife and mother are never given the respected title 'Mrs.'; when you are harried by day and hunted--haunted by night by the fact that you are a negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you, when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of 'nobodiness,' then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of--cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience."

Years later, James Baldwin, in the same documentary I mentioned, is interviewed by somebody in the early seventies, saying, you know, "You're so angry, you're so impatient. These changes you're talking about take time."  He shoots back,

"You say it takes time. It's taken my father's time and my mother's time, my brother's and sister's time, my grandfather's and grandmother's time, my nephew's and niece's time. How much time do you want for your so-called progress?"

What is the pace of change?  It's going too fast for white moderates. Not going nearly fast enough for African Americans and white activists. So King writes the Letter from Birmingham Jail over Easter weekend in 1963. Meanwhile, marches are being organized in Birmingham, organized from the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, to try to call attention to the general plight that African Americans face in Birmingham, the injustice, injustice of the situation. And Bull Connor responds, quite famously, "I want to see the dogs work," and then, "Look at those niggers run."  As marches are organized, he would release the dogs, order his deputies to release the dogs. You've seen the images, of course. Open up the fire cannons. They actually had a tank, a police tank, that was brought out to terrorize the citizens. A decision is made by King and his circle to raise the stakes. And by raising the stakes, that means using children.

By the end of the first day, children marching in defiance of orders, leaving school, a thousand children aged between six, six and eighteen are thrown in jail. By the next day, the number doubles. Robert F. Kennedy, he was leading a civil rights agenda for his brother, John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy is beside himself. He could not believe that King would risk these children's lives, as he put it, for the sake of more media coverage, more negative press. This is what he was doing, there's no doubt about it, that King is trying to antagonize the situation and horrify the nation by revealing what Bull Connor would actually do, and Bull Connor took the bait. He doesn't care. Birmingham becomes a media circus, as people from around the country are horrified at what they bear witness to. With all the media around, a truce is negotiated. Lunch counters open to blacks, they become integrated. Promises are made that blacks are going to begin--going to get hired in clerical and sales positions, thus avoiding economic boycotts.

But that doesn't mean there's peace. Martin Luther King's brother's house is bombed. The hotel that was a staging ground for a lot of the organizers, who were coming in from out of town, the hotel was bombed. Federal troops, Robert F. Kennedy convinces his brother, "You've got to bring federal troops if you want to have stability."  So federal troops come and occupy Birmingham to keep the peace. While all of this is going on, to speak of the sort of the heightened tension around various hotspots in the South and local and states' rights versus federal rights, James Meredith, a few months earlier, inspired by Kennedy's election and inauguration, applies for and is accepted at Old Miss, the flagship school in Mississippi, where Mississippi's elite get trained. James Meredith, a black man of course, integrates the school, but only with federal protection, but the federal protection didn't matter, since there were riots on campus surrounding Meredith's arrival. His likeness is hung in effigy and federal marshals are killed.


Chapter 3. John Kennedy Pushes for a Civil Rights Bill [00:16:45]

George Wallace, governor of Alabama, who you saw in an advanced stage of his life in the documentary, who when he was running for election earlier in his career and lost, when he was a moderate Democrat, lost to a race a, you know, a, a race-wielding demagogue, declared earlier that he would never be "out-niggered" again, and becomes this creature, spewing racism and populism at every turn. Wallace, at his inauguration, declares, "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever."  In June of Sixty-Three, after the riots in Birmingham, Wallace participates in a staged act of resistance. He knows he's going to lose it already, but he goes through this performance, and he refuses to let the University of Alabama be integrated. And he literally stands at the doorway of the, I think, the registrar's offices, he's outside of the building, refusing to let these two black students integrate University of Alabama. JFK knew about it. He'd already dispatched people to negotiate a situation, and the federal government, embodied in I think is Nick Katzenbach, essentially gets the students in the school. So the federal government is now intervening in state affairs in ways that, that could lead to, without exaggeration, another kind of sectional crisis.

That night, the same night that Wallace is moved aside and the University of Alabama is integrated, John F. Kennedy appears on national TV. And he asks, [clears throat] excuse me, he asks for Congress to give him legislation that would give everyone the right to be served in facilities that are open to the public. He declares--essentially asking for a civil rights bill. He declares, and I quote here, "We are confronted, excuse me, we are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and yet as clear as the American Constitution," linking the battle that he wants to fight, asking Congress to give him the tools to fight, a battle that is one, bound up in the Constitution, but is also bound up with fundamental morality and an ethical sense of life. Astonishing for a President to step out like that, so astonishing that a man named Byron de la Beckwith, a white guy down in Mississippi, snaps. And hours after Kennedy--this is broadcast nationally on the news--hours after Kennedy makes this declaration, Byron de la Beckwith is hiding behind some bushes across the street from Medgar Evers's house, Medgar Evers being the, the head of NAACP in Mississippi. He wanted to be also involved in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, but they made him pick and choose, so he chose the NAACP. Byron de la Beckwith shoots Medgar Evers from a high-powered rifle, kills him, the driveway of his home.

Beckwith is not sentenced for thirty-five years. It's part of a whole other conversation we might have at the end of the course about what some might call a generation in the South trying to find racial healing, decades after the events that these atrocities happen. So JFK goes on TV and says the federal government needs to respond to this moral failing in our country. Medgar Evers is murdered. In due course, a civil rights bill is introduced that would outlaw segregation in all interstate public accommodations. It would allow the attorney general to initiate suits for school integration. And, very importantly, it would give the attorney general power, the power to stop funding for any federal program where discrimination is found to have occurred. It's a bill that's mostly about enforcement, saying the federal government can get involved via the attorney general enforcing substantive and real change, along the lines of civil rights.


Chapter 4. The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom [00:21:50]

King, as the head of SCLC, leaders of CORE, Congress of Racial Equality, NAACP, SNCC, the National Urban League, come together. It's a group that squabbles quite a bit, but they come together and they are committed to seeing this bill actually pass. And they declare, much like A. Philip Randolph--well exactly like A. Philip Randolph declared some twenty-two years earlier, they call for a March on Washington. Kennedy went apoplectic. He goes, "This kind of agitating is going to kill any chance that the civil rights bill is going to pass. You have to be calm and quiet, you know. It's not so much a go slow mentality, but just be calm. Don't agitate. Don't stir up the water."  Kennedy is simply horrified. But the civil rights leaders have no intention of backing down. The march happens at the very end of August 1963, August twenty-eighth. Just over a month before the march, Kennedy relents and actually endorses it. So Kennedy's trying for a solid month, month and a half, to get the march canceled quietly, you know, working with these civil rights leaders. It's now quite customary for the President to be talking with civil rights leaders, something that was revolutionary in 1941. You know, they're now called into the White House with regularity, or they're just talking to him on the phone.

Kennedy realizes they're not going to back down; he decides to endorse the march. But he endorses it on a couple of terms: that the federal government will have control over it, in the sense of, if things get out of line, we'll kill the sound system. We reserve the right to look at all the speeches before they're actually given. You know, they, they're saying from a peace and safety standpoint that it's really about trying to control this march so it doesn¡¯t get out of hand in the federal government's terms. Now it's important to think of the march--we know a lot about it from our, you know, our civics classes in high school, and certainly it's part of our sort of national rhetoric of exceptionalism, but there's a lot of things we don't know about the march, that they don't talk about.

First of all, just the name itself, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Jobs was a major part of the March on Washington. It's not just King standing up there talking about a dream he's having. It's labor movements, religious organizations, civil rights organizations, working together, calling for the passage of the civil rights bill, calling for a two dollar minimum wage, calling for the immediate desegregation of schools, calling for a federal public works program, along the lines of New Deal works program I talked about a couple of weeks ago, calling for, calling for real federal action to ban discrimination in employment, not just press conferences like the FEPC used to do, but real action. So the goals of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, passage of civil rights bill, minimum wage, desegregated schools, public works program, and real federal action to ban discrimination in employment.

The march is remembered, of course, as a benevolent, benevolent and transcendent moment, but if you've already done your reading in, in the Marable and Mullings book, you'll know that the story's a little more complicated than that. John Lewis, currently representative of Congress, then the new head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, John Lewis has a chance to go to the microphone, he prepares a speech, the original version of which is in your text. It is not a speech about love and joy, rainbows and unicorns, and all that kind of lovely stuff. It's a speech that called out on the Kennedy--blamed the Kennedy government for its moral failings. It attacked the very hand that, in a sense, "allowed" the march to go forward. And in many people's opinions, even if they agreed with Lewis, they're saying, "There's no way that you can actually say this, cause you will antagonize to the point, we will, this will kill the civil rights bill." And Lewis goes, "I'm going to say what I'm going to say." 

As word of that gets leaked out to people who are about to go on up to the podium, one of the religious leaders, Cardinal, Cardinal--whose name, last name I'm blanking on. I'm thinking of other cardinals in the news for other reasons, the last few years--a, a cardinal says, "I'll leave the podium if you say this."  Walter Reuther says, "If you say this, I'm gone."  Basically, at the moment at--just before the, the speakers go live, there's a real chance the whole thing is going to fall apart. Lewis finally agrees to give an edited version of the speech, and that's the speech that he gives. And the people out in the audience have no idea about what's happened behind stage. They also don't know, mainly because of what Lewis is threatening to do, that the administration had positioned agents by the loudspeakers, control panels, to kill the entire sound system, to silence the march. And who knows what would have happened, had that actually gone forward.


Chapter 5. Martin Luther King, Jr: "I Have a Dream" [00:27:49]

So the narrative behind the march itself, and, the, the, the how you get to the march actually happening and what's actually said there, is, is different than what people normally have been taught to consume. What they've been taught to consume is this:

[Martin Luther King, Jr:] So even though we face difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today!"

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  You all know these, this passage. Whether you know it by heart or not is a different issue. In a couple of weeks, when we, the course resumes, when we're getting into the 1980s and nineties and such, we'll come back to this last part of this. I wanted to play this main section here, because the last part is actually used for different, quite different purposes, as we get into the 1990s, in a new era of, sort of race politics, a confusing era all the same. But in this moment, this is, I mean it's gorgeous. This beautiful passage about a person having a reverie about possibility, thinking about a day in which the color of their skin is not going to determine their life chances. I have no quarrel with celebrating this part of the speech, certainly. But what of other parts of the speech?  How come we don¡¯t know a part, very early on, five paragraphs into his speech, when he says:

"In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the 'unalienable Rights" of Law--of 'Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.' It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.'"

That¡¯s a very--I mean imagine if that was the message that we grew up in our elementary schools listening to in black history month, as we all know, it's been trotted out during that particular month. That's a very different message to walk away from with the March on Washington: America has failed on its promise to provide equality for all its citizens, and it's couched in the terms of capital. Significantly different speech if you just excerpt that part. Or, what if you excerpted this part?

[Martin Luther King, Jr.:] We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: 'For Whites Only.' We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until 'justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.'"

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Now that's in the middle of his speech, as he's preparing for the crescendo that would turn into the "I Have a Dream" sort of call and response, in a sense. So you have a King in the earliest part of this speech talking about the failures of the American republic to abide by its own Declaration of Independence and its own Constitution. The message hasn't changed from the night before the March on--excuse me, the Montgomery bus boycott, when King says, "If we're wrong in all of what we're doing, the Supreme Court is wrong and the Constitution is wrong." He's calling for the country to live up to its legal mandates and, of course, its ethical mandates as well. And he's also, although he certainly abides by the philosophy of turning the other cheek, it should not be allowed to be mistaken for sort of the positive and hopeful reverie of the "I Have a Dream moment."  He is saying we cannot be satisfied, we cannot stop, harkening back, I think, to Du Bois who--W. E. B. Du Bois, who died the day before the March on Washington. Talk about, sort of, theatrical timing, not to make light of it. It's rather astonishing though. He died an expatriate in Ghana, having essentially been kicked out of--well kicked himself out of the country, after the country took his passport for a while, for his alleged communist sympathizing.

But Du Bois was talking about "returning, returning from fighting, returning fighting" and King is saying the same thing, "We can never be satisfied," as long as you can't vote in Mississippi and as long as there's no reason to vote in New York. And he's harkening, by the way, at that moment, to the fact that--you know, I've been talking about the South a lot, and I will be talking about the South some more. But as we'll see later in a couple of weeks, this is a national problem. It's just articulated in different ways. So what would the narrative of the "I Have a Dream" speech be, if the title was: "We Can Never Be Satisfied"?  Or if the title were: "Insufficient Funds"?  That's a different kind of speech. And we need to think about the consequences of these naming conventions, of these excerpting conventions, of these ways that we learn about individuals like King who become mythic for every good reason, I don't want to dismiss it, but become something other than what they might have been, if you just looked at their rhetoric, looked at their approach in a slightly different angle.


Chapter 6. Final Thoughts [00:36:25]

All that said, there's no denying the fact that right after the march, there was this sort of giddy feeling of hope, of benevolence, of transcendence. I can't rewrite history that way. There's a sense of real change in the air, the change that is shattered or, excuse me, a sense that is shattered two weeks later when those four little girls are blown to bits in Birmingham. Now the King you hear in "I Have a Dream" or--speech or Montgomery bus boycott speech, is a King who is buoyant, hopeful, angry perhaps, concerned, but with a, a narrative power that suggests possibility in a positive way. Let me play a clip of a different King.

[Martin Luther King, Jr.: ] "These children, unoffending, innocent, and beautiful, were the victims of one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity. And yet they died nobly. They are the martyred heroines of a holy crusade for freedom and human dignity. And so this afternoon in a real sense they have something to say to each of us in their death. They have something to say to every minister of the gospel who has remained silent behind the safe security of stained-glass windows. They have something to say to every politician who has fed his constituents with the stale bread of hatred and the spoiled meat of racism. They have something to say to a federal government that has compromised with the undemocratic practices of southern Dixiecrats and the blatant hypocrisy of right-wing northern Republicans. They have something to say to every Negro who has passively accepted the evil system of segregation and who has stood on the sidelines in a mighty struggle for justice. They say to each of us, black and white alike, that we must substitute courage for caution. They say to us that we must be concerned not merely about who murdered them, but about the system, the way of life, the philosophy which produced the murderers. Their death says to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American dream. And so my friends, they did not die in vain."

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  King giving the eulogy at the funeral honoring the four young girls who were blown, blown, blown up. This is a King you don't hear much about, a King who's despairing, who's exhausted, and feels hopeless. It's important to know that King ran through the whole vector of human emotion, certainly, and was on more than one occasion pushed to the limits. Other people, of course, pushed to the limits, acting out in different kinds of ways. I began today's lecture playing a clip from We Shall Overcome, a song talking about--I mean doesn't take much to read into it--overcoming those moments when you are taxed beyond belief. It's an anthem of the movement; it's a very important song. We know it. Even if you don't know the words, you can fake sing through it. You know, people next to you can sing a little louder, cover up the fact you don't know what the next line is. But you know how the tune goes, right?  But we don't hear about other artists offering different interpretations of this moment. After the four young women are blown up, Nina Simone, a famous jazz artist, produces a protest song. It becomes one of her signature pieces, much like Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit. It's a very long song. I'm going to play, you know, a portion of it. The lyrics should be clear enough, but I'll actually show them up here as well. It's called "Mississippi Goddam."

[Nina Simone: (singing)] "Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

This is a show tune
But the show hasn't been written for it, yet

Hound dogs on my trail
School children sitting in jail
Black cat cross my path
I think every day's gonna be my last

Lord have mercy on this land of mine
We all gonna get it in due time
I don't belong here
I don't belong there
I've even stopped believing in prayer

Don't tell me
I tell you
Me and my people just about due
I've been there so I know
They keep on saying 'Go slow!'

But that's just the trouble
'do it slow'
Washing the windows
'do it slow'
Picking the cotton
'do it slow'
You're just plain rotten
'do it slow'
You're too damn lazy
'do it slow'
The thinking's crazy
'do it slow'
Where am I going
What am I doing
I don't know
I don't know

Just try to do your very best
Stand up be counted with all the rest
For everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

I made you thought I was kiddin' didn't we.

Picket lines
School boycotts
They try to say it's a communist plot
All I want is equality
for my sister my brother my people and me

Yes you lied to me all these years
You told me to wash and clean my ears
And talk real fine just like a lady
And you'd stop calling me Sister Sadie

Oh but this whole country is full of lies
You're all gonna die and die like flies
I don't trust you any more
You keep on saying 'Go slow!'
'Go slow!'

But that's just the trouble
'do it slow'
Desegregation
'do it slow'
Mass participation
'do it slow'
Reunification
'do it slow'
Do things gradually
'do it slow'
But bring more tragedy
'do it slow'
Why don't you see it
Why don't you feel it
I don't know
I don't know

You don't have to live next to me
Just give me my equality
Everybody knows about Mississippi
Everybody knows about Alabama
Everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

That's it!"

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Now it's a genius song, and since it, you know, it's played to the tune of a bouncy show tune and she was known for doing, you know, jazz standards and her own songs, playing the American songbook. And then she's telling her largely white audiences to go to hell. And they ate it up. That, you know, she's calling the people who expected civil rights activists to be respectable, wash behind their ears, to hell with that as well. And the beloved country that King is talking about, that can go to hell as well. In fact, it is going to hell, because they just blew up four children and no one's going to pay the consequences for it. This is an important narrative of the Civil Rights Movement. You need to understand it. And you also need to understand the fact that it's dropped out, and that's really the, the significance of it all, is that we know certain things about the movement and not others, and we need to ask the question why. That brings to close my lecture. The TAs are going to fan out a little separately over here to distribute your papers and your midterm exams. And even though I know you have other classes to go to, I wish you a lovely spring break. Thanks.
Lecture 16 - From Voting Rights to Watts [March 22, 2010]
Chapter 1. Introduction: Reframing the Civil Rights Movement Iconic Figures [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Alright, why don't we go ahead and get started. I¡¯m going to beg your--Welcome back from spring break. I hope you all had a lovely time of it. I'll apologize at the beginning. I have gotten sick right at the end of spring break, so if you can hear me in the back?  Is that, is that fine in the back?  Okay. I don't have much more than this in the tank. Okay. Now, I know you've all done the reading for the week already and I know that you remember everything I was saying at the last minute before break, but just for my sake, I'll just remind you that we were just wrapping up talking about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and the assassination of the four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama, essentially spending the time, much of our last week of lecture, dealing, dealing with these iconographic individuals and moments in Martin Luther King and the March on Washington, and trying to unravel a lot of the more familiar historiography or history around these individuals. What I want to do today is to continue in that work of reframing the Civil Rights Movement iconic figures and spend today's lecture talking about Malcolm X.

Now a couple of caveats, maybe just one caveat, to begin with is that for this week¡¯s, this week's lectures are going to be overlapping themselves, so that we have today talking about Malcolm X from say, well his, his biography essentially, till his assassination in sixty-five, and then on Wednesday, we're going to go back over the time period between roughly '63 and '65. It's the simplest way that I know of to make sure that we handle a new understanding of, of Malcolm X, or maybe a different understanding, and also make sure we get the events on the ground that are happening at the same time. So the chronology's overlapping.


Chapter 2. A Sampling of Malcolm X¡¯s Famous Rhetoric [00:01:42]

Okay, with that explanation out of the way, let me begin with a sampling of Malcolm X's famous rhetoric, and this one is following the March on Washington. So we're talking about now in August of 1963. When asked about the March on Washington, Malcolm X replied or giving a, giving a speech--this is an excerpt from Message to the Grassroots:

"No, it was a sellout. It was a takeover. When James Baldwin came in from Paris, they wouldn¡¯t let him talk, because they couldn¡¯t make him go by the script. Burt Lancaster read the speech that Baldwin was supposed to make; they wouldn¡¯t let Baldwin get up there, because they know, they know Baldwin¡¯s liable to say anything. They controlled it so tight ¡ª¡ª they told those negroes what time to hit town, how to come, where to stop, what signs to carry, what song to sing, what speech they could make, and what speech they couldn¡¯t make; and then told them to get out town by sundown. And every one of those Toms was out of town by sundown. Now I know you don¡¯t like say--my saying this, but I can, I can back it up. It was a circus, a performance that beat anything Hollywood could ever do, the performance of the year. (Walter Reuther, labor leader) Walter Reuther and those other three devils should get a Academy Award for the best actors because they acted like they really loved negroes and fooled a whole lot of negroes. And the six negro leaders should get an award too, for the best supporting cast."

It's quite a statement. This is again from Message to the Grassroots, although he would respond to other people that the speech was nothing but a circus on other occasions, it's delivered shortly before Malcolm X breaks with the Nation of Islam and Elijah Muhammad. The reading for this week, one of the readings, Malcolm X Speaks, excerpts, a collection of, of talks edited by George Brightman, are all ex--speeches from Message to the Grassroots to the end of Malcolm X's life, a, a time period that's rather important for reasons you'll see as the course of the lecture--over the course of this lecture. Now Malcolm X was famous for rhetoric like referring to the March on Washington as a circus and for other, other sort of notorious, infamous statements. I want to play a couple of other excerpts, because there's nothing like hearing the person speaking. The first is from--and I'll let the two speeches run together. You'll, you¡¯ll notice the break, definitely. The first is from The Ballot or the Bullet and the second is from The Black--The Black Revolution.

[Malcolm X:]  This is why I say it¡¯s the ballot or the bullet. It¡¯s liberty or it¡¯s death. It¡¯s freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody. America today finds herself in a unique situation. Historically, revolutions are bloody. Oh, yes, they are. They haven¡¯t ever had a blood-less revolution, or a non-violent revolution. That don¡¯t happen even in Hollywood. You don¡¯t have a revolution in which you love your enemy, and you don¡¯t have a revolution in which you are begging the system of exploitation to integrate you into it. Revolutions overturn systems. Revolution destroys systems. A revolution is bloody, but America is in a unique position. She's the only country in history in a position actually to become involved in a blood-less revolution. All she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's due him, everything. I hope that the white man can see this, because if you don't see it you're finished. If you don't see it you're going to be coming--you're going to become involved in some action in which you don't have a chance. And we don't care anything about your atomic bomb; it's, it¡¯s useless because other countries have atomic bombs. When two or three different countries have atomic bombs, nobody can use them, so it means that the white man today is without a weapon. If you're going--if you want some action, you've got to come on down to Earth. And there's more black people on Earth than there are white people on Earth. It'll be--it'll be the, the ballot or it'll be the bullet. It'll be liberty or it'll be death. And if you're not ready to pay that price, don't use the word freedom in your vocabulary."

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  That's the end of the first clip. And the second clip begins right now.

[Malcolm X:] "We should defend ourselves. And when I say we should defend ourselves against the violence of others, that if they use their press skillfully to make the world think that I'm calling on violence period, and I wouldn't call on anybody to be violent without a cause. But I think the black man in this country, above and beyond people all over the world, will be more justified when he stands up and starts to protect himself, no matter how many necks he has to break or heads he has to crack."

[recording starts from beginning and you can hear the following] This is why I say it¡¯s the ballot or the bullet.


Chapter 3. What was Unique about Malcolm X? [00:07:47]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  So it's important to ask, when thinking about Malcolm X, and these--playing these excerpts, are we hearing a different kind of voice?  Are we hearing a different engagement or interpretation with the present moment, 1964?  Are we hearing a different agenda?  Is this what makes Malcolm X so different from Martin Luther King and other famous African American leaders?  Well, you know by now that what he's asking for in The Ballot or the Bullet, the excerpt from the speech The Ballot or the Bullet, he's asking for civil rights. He says there's no need for a bloody revolution, certainly. All he's asking is for that--for the black man what is due him, he says in the quote. Is he doing something new when he's asking for these things?  You can go back to the Niagara Movement in 1905 and hear a lot of the same kinds of things that Malcolm X is seeking.

Okay now the Niagara Movement wasn't calling for violence upon violence, in, in response to violence, self-defense, not that way. So one might say well he was doing something new there. But even then, no. If you look back to Robert Williams in the 1950s, head of the NAACP chapter in North Carolina, something I've already brought up before and in your reader, he was calling for black men to, you know, gather up their arms and respond with force. So Malcolm X is talking really in a longer tradition, certainly a long tradition of calling for full civil rights and equality, and, and speaking in a long tradition as well, although much less talked about and much less consistent really, but always there, about violent self-defense, embracing violence, if, if this is--embracing self-defense, and if that means using violence, so be it.
Now why is this lingering, worth lingering over?  It's worth it because like Martin Luther King, Malcolm X's life is frozen in time. We'll be coming back next to King next week and you¡¯ll--I'll flesh out that statement more completely. But like Martin Luther King, Malcolm X is frozen in time. And really frozen in time incorrectly. Malcolm X's life is encapsulated by just, you know, the phrase "By any means necessary."  Certainly, gosh, I can't remember how many years ago now, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X came out, there was just an amazing moment at the commodification of Malcolm X, embodied in really cool baseball caps with a white X on the front, or in t-shirt and such. And, you know, that's how you kept it real, by walking around town wearing that kind of outfit, wearing Malcolm X, and his belief system, allegedly with an over--overpriced cap you're wearing or the t-shirt. The fact is that the popularized, commodified image of Malcolm X is also one that's out of date. In fact, by the end of his life, he was not even known as Malcolm X, and he distanced himself in an incremental fashion from a lot of his most famous declarations in the early 1960s.
Chapter 4. Who was Malcolm X? [00:11:35]

So who is then Malcolm X?  Let's work through the biography. His birth name is Malcolm Little. He was born in 1925. He's assassinated in February 1965, less than a year after he breaks from the Nation of Islam. Now this, this little fact is actually inconsequential, but it is funny the way we think about things, that Martin Luther King is the, you know, middle class, moderate, grownup and Malcolm X, the fiery, youthful ambassador to the Nation of Islam, in a sense. But Malcolm X is older than Martin Luther King by four years. I mean, yeah, it's kind of inconsequential, but it actually speaks to the way in which we kind of remember these people in our minds. Both of them were very young men. So Malcolm Little is born in 1925. He's known over the course of his life as Detroit Red, as Malcolm X most famously, and finally as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. He's a child, a middle child, of eight. His father's a Baptist minister, and an organizer for Marcus Garvey's UNIA. There's different versions about Malcolm X's early life and you know, forgive me, I will, I will often use Malcolm X in this lecture, just out of old habits.

There's not a whole bunch about Malcolm Little's life. His father has died, either murdered by a Klan styled group in Michigan, the Black Legionnaires, or died an accidental death. In either case, Malcolm's fatherless at age six. The family disintegrates. Malcolm Little drops out of school, moves to Boston and then to Harlem, and becomes a hustler. He's running numbers, selling drugs, he's pimping, and is a petty thief. During this era in his life, he's adopted the street moniker as Detroit Red. At twenty-one--and I've just, and I¡¯ve encapsulated, or sort of put parentheses around the first twenty-one years of his life in just that little biographical sketch--at twenty-one, he's arrested and sent to prison for burglary and larceny. He's given an eight to ten year sentence and ultimately serves six and a half years. He's paroled in 1952, about twenty-seven years old. While he's in prison, he has a religious conversion. He--while he's in prison, he's converted to the Nation of Islam, and adopts the name Malcolm X. The X is a reference to a long legacy of African Americans who were in an enslaved past who were given the master's last name. And X is a, is a decoration that they are wiping out the slave name from their past, and they're speaking to an unknown past, but claiming it as their own. [student sneezes] Bless you.

Anyway, Malcolm X, now, is a member of the Lost Found Nation of Islam in the Wilderness of North America. That's the full name. The Lost Found Nation of Islam in the Wilderness of North America. It's a religious sect founded by a rather shadowy person, we really don't know much about him at all, named Wallace Fard, founded around 1930. Fard disappears under curious circumstances. I¡¯ve never seen anything convince--convincing of what actually happened to Fard, but one of the people he brought into his circle before he disappears is a janitor in Detroit, Michigan, in Detroit, Michigan named Elijah Poole. Elijah Poole becomes the spiritual head of the religious organization known as the Nation of Islam and renames himself Elijah Muhammad. Now the Nation of Islam is a very unorthodox version of traditional Islam. There's barely any connection between the two in truth, at least at that moment in time. The Nation of Islam grafts together black nationalism and some Islamic fundamentals. Elijah Muhammad teaches, through the Nation of Islam, to his disciples, his followers. That Muhammad taught--excuse me, I lost my place in my notes here.

Muhammad taught that whites were a mutant race of blue-eyed devils, created by, created by a mad black scientist to persecute black people. As the messenger of God, Elijah Muhammad would free his followers one day when Allah's apocalyptic wrath finally destroyed whites. In the meantime, the black Muslims, followers of the Nation of Islam, the black Muslims would offer hope to blacks through self-discipline and self-help. So the Creation myth revolves around a, a crazed black scientist who fashions white to persecute blacks. Just as bizarre as any other Creation myth, I suppose, that's out there. Anyway, this is what it is. And that black Muslims would, would be the population to help blacks through this time of struggle, through teaching self-discipline and self-help. This is one of the reasons the Nation of Islam is so traditionally--been so powerful at, or so successful at, converting people who are in prison. Teaching self discipline and self help, being those things that are most desperately needed, often, by those who are in prison, after all. Teaching race pride as well, independence.

Anyway, shortly after his release from prison, Malcolm X meets Elijah Muhammad and becomes an assistant minister in Detroit temple number one. This is where the Nation is headquartered. Malcolm X, despite the interesting ways he's been historicized, one cannot deny the fact that he's an incredibly charismatic speaker, powerful speaker. Elijah Muhammad recognizes this and very quickly sends Malcolm X to, to Harlem, and establishes him as the minister of the Harlem temple. And although it's not the headquarters of the Nation of Islam, because it's in Harlem, sort of black Manhattan, it very quickly becomes the most important temple. And Elijah Muhammad asks, asks Malcolm X to be his--the national spokesman for the Nation of Islam. So very quickly, Malcolm X goes from jail to meeting Elijah Muhammad, to becoming assistant minister at the Detroit temple, to becoming the head of the Harlem temple, to becoming the spokesman for the Nation of Islam, although he's not the head of the Nation of Islam.

Under Malcolm X's charismatic leadership, the Nation of Islam grows exponentially. It's really very small in the 1950s. It grows from several hundred followers to over ten thousand by the early 1960s. Still rather small, of course. As Malcolm X continues to speak and advocate, the membership grows and new temples are established. Radio stations are purchased. Stores are opened up. The Nation of Islam in their early 1960s, late fifties, early sixties, is tapping into a growing disaffection within black America, particularly urban and northern black America. This is a movement that is overwhelmingly northern at this point in time. The Steel Belt, Steel Belt, thinking along the, the northern, middle west of the United States, Ohio and Pittsburgh, heading across to Michigan, is becoming the Rust Belt, going through a period of deindustrialization. The jobs that caused blacks to migrate north to the--after the Second World War are going away and they're stuck in crumbling ghettoes.

And the rhetorical flair of Malcolm, I¡¯m sorry of Martin Luther King's speeches--this is also the period of King's greatest triumphs--aren't doing anything to change the daily quality, quality of life for most blacks, particularly those living outside of the South. So if you're stuck in a slum apartment in Detroit, Michigan or Chicago, Illinois, the powerful rhetoric that's coming from King and the struggles in Birmingham, Montgomery, and other places, they aren't putting food on your table, they aren't changing what happens when you look for a job. Malcolm X's rhetoric isn't necessarily putting food on the table, but when you marry the rhetoric with the establishment of these temples and stores, Nation of Islam stores, and laundries--if you think back to Marcus Garvey's UNIA, black owned, entrepreneurial opportunities, serving a black community--that's what the Nation of Islam is doing as well. If you tap into¡ªif, if you are, are listening to Malcolm X's rhetoric and actually going to a temple, then maybe going to a store, you're finding yourself in a community that will help you.

So Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam are tapping into something sort of festering, disillusioned urban slum dwellers. There's growing skepticism in black America about the worth of integrating into the white mainstream, with James Baldwin famously saying, "Why would I want to integrate into a burning house?"  There's a growing increase in support for violent methods to solve problems and a surge in nationalist sentiment among African Americans not seen since the Garvey years, since the height of the Garvey movement in the nineteen-teens and the 1920s. All of these things working together are increasing the numbers in the Nation of Islam, developing a broader support base. Now the Nation is a religious organization and was steadfast in its refusal to get involved in contemporary electoral politics, very different from Southern Christian Leadership Conference, for example, SNCC, other organizations.

The Nation is a religious organization. Had a very conservative social view, very much along the lines of Booker T. Washington's notions of self-help. It is racially separatist. It's not embracing any of the integrating logics of, of SNCC at that point, or NAACP, or other groups. Malcolm X, in fact, had represented Elijah Muhammad in the Nation in negotiations with the national heads of the KKK and the American Nazi Party. Thinking back to Marcus Garvey, believing that the head of the Klan was the most honest white man in America. You have the same kind of mentality being expressed in the Nation of Islam. But all is not well with the Nation of Islam either. There are whisperings, as we get into the early 1960s, that Elijah Muhammad and the allegations he's having affairs with teenage members of the Nation, whisperings he's actually impregnated several members of the Nation, and then publicly rebuked the same young women for fornication, never naming himself in the process and getting them thrown out of the Nation. There have been whisperings for a long time about financial improprieties, and there's an increasing sense of frustration, certainly felt by Malcolm X, but also by other members of the Nation, that coming down from Elijah Muhammad is a steadfast refusal to get involved in the politics of the day. There's also a tension created by the fact that Malcolm X is increasingly popular and although he's not the leader of the Nation, because he is the spokesperson for the Nation, he is seen as embodying the Nation.

So we're in 1963. John F. Kennedy is assassinated in November, and Malcolm X, because he is such a prominent individual in the Nation, was asked what he thought about this moment, this moment of great national tragedy, and white and black Americans are devastated that the seeming prince of a person had been cut down. And Malcolm X very famously says, "It was merely a case of the chickens coming home to roost."  That's a response that Malcolm X meant to use to highlight the fact that JFK lived by the sword, and he was quite a saber-rattler as a President, that he lived by the sword and therefore he was going to die by it. Whether Malcolm X's comment made any sense or not, it was a comment that horrified the country. Elijah Muhammad saw this as an opportunity, as it turns out. He is getting feedback, whisperings as well, that Malcolm X is becoming too popular, that Malcolm X is, is growing away from the Nation and from Elijah Muhammad. Elijah Muhammad is concerned about his ability to control Malcolm X.


Chapter 5. Malcolm X Breaks Away from the Nation of Islam [00:27:34]

So Muhammad jumps on this opportunity and silences Malcolm X for ninety days, based on that comment. He was not allowed to represent the Nation of Islam and not to speak on the Nation's behalf. Now from a standpoint of public policy, it made perfect sense. I mean, this is such a, a moment of anger, folks on the Nation of Islam, that to have anything less than silenced Malcolm X would have been, would have been seen as to support this notion of chickens coming home to roost. But the truth really does lie elsewhere in terms of Elijah Muhammad's anxiety, growing anxiety about Malcolm X and his popularity, and also because Malcolm X had confronted Muhammad about his affairs, that he'd heard that these things were happening. He was waiting for Elijah Muhammad to refute them, and he never could. Financial improprieties, he couldn't refute those either. During this moratorium, this ninety day silence, it becomes clear to Malcolm X that his silence, his ban on public speaking would not be lifted, and so he breaks from the Nation of Islam.

His speech, Message to the Grassroots, which I spoke from at the beginning of the lecture, it's one of the last speeches he gives before he breaks from the Nation. And if you look back at it, you can see sort of the handwriting on the wall, because peppered throughout Malcolm X's declarations would be, you know, that he speaks on behalf of the honorable Elijah Muhammad. "As the honorable Elijah Muhammad says,"  "The honorable, honorable Elijah Muhammad believes" this that and the other. He can't say it in this speech. He's growing apart. So the split becomes official in March of 1964. Malcolm X establishes a religious organization called the Muslim Mosque Incorporated, and a political organization called the Organization of Afro-American Unity, thus reflecting, or creating, this two headed--or maybe these two organizations on, on separate paths. Certainly embodying a belief by Malcolm X that broad social engagement provided blacks the best chance for ending racism, not just a set of personal belief systems, but also engaging the battle on the ground. This was the political aspect of the OAAU, the Organization, Organization of Afro-American Unity that Malcolm X felt was lost--a lost opportunity for the Nation of Islam.

Before establishing the OAAU, Malcolm X makes a hajj, a religious journey to Mecca, and during that trip has a stunning change of heart on race relations. Very famously in the autobiography of Malcolm X, written by Alex Haey, you see Malcolm X talking about meeting Muslims who were whiter than the whitest person he'd seen in the United States, blue eyes and blond hair. He had a very sort of immature notion of what traditional Muslim--Islamic faith was like and what Muslims would, quote, look like, even. So whites are no longer the blue-eyed devil in Malcolm X's view. His outlook, his political, religious, and ethical outlook, which certainly is revolutionary while he's with the Nation of Islam, becomes increasingly anti-capitalist. And this is something we're going to see, not just in Malcolm X's belief system, but in other leaders' belief systems, as we head into the mid and late 1960s. Anti-capitalist thinking and rhetoric becomes much more important and is certainly a string that ties a lot of these individuals together, although that linkage is often not talked about.

He rejects his prior views on race. He rejects the idea of black separatism. He rejects his anti-Semitism. He rejects his opposition to intermarriage. All of these are views that he espoused while in the Nation of Islam. He comes to recognize that women actually did have an important role to play in the political struggle. And he begins to accept and look for--accept the idea of and look for alliances of black organizations with other groups committed to revolutionary change. This is a complete change of heart. His prior views on race, race separatism, his, his notion of the role Jews played in the world system, his anti-Semitic views, his opposition to intermarriage, all of those are gone. Women might have a role in the struggle. Whites are no longer blue-eyed devils. There could be other organizations blacks could relate to, attach themselves to, as long as they're working towards revolutionary change. In the end, Malcolm X acknowledged that his political views are rapidly evolving, embodied in the fact that he no longer goes by Malcolm X. El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz is the name he adopts during this last conversion.

He admits, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, that--when asked, that he was hard pressed to give a specific definition of the overall philosophy which he thought was necessary for the liberation of black people in the United States. He didn't know at this point what the right answer was. This is between middle of sixty-four and early 1965. Now Malcolm X is assassinated in February of 1965 by members of the Nation of Islam. There's been rumor mills running nonstop since then about who was really behind the assassination, I mean, beyond the folks who actually pulled the triggers. But was it a man now known as Louis Farrakhan, someone scrambling for attention from Elijah Muhammad, who inspired or gave directions to the, the, the murderers?  Was it the FBI infiltrating the NOI, to find a way to assassinate Malcolm X, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, although he's no longer part of the Nation of Islam?  The debate's been going on really, I mean, through the very recent past, during bizarre sets of events that leads to some sort of reconciliation, I suppose, with Louis Farrakhan and Malcolm X's--one of his daughters or grand?--must be daughters, I suppose, and Louis Farrakhan saying that, you know, he apologizes if someone had misinterpreted his views or ideas in such a way that they might--thought it might be okay to assassinate Malcolm X, one of these squirrelly kind of apologies. Fact of the matter remains that Malcolm X, El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, is murdered February 1965.


Chapter 6. Malcolm X¡¯s Legacy [00:36:14]

What does he leave behind?  He leaves behind no great leadership legacy, but in terms of, you know, what organization was left, what did he do, he'd broken from the organization that had defined most of his life, his adult life. The OAAU and the Muslim Mosque Incorporated at the moment of his assassination were really inchoate. His views were shifting. He couldn't answer the question, what is going to be the most successful means to liberating black Americans?  He didn't know the answer. But we, you know, it¡¯s, even though he leaves no clear leadership legacy behind, can he be judged by normal standards of his leadership--by normal standards of leadership?  His martyrdom, as it turns out, gives him--gave him his legitimacy. Critics have said that his emotionalism, his powerful rhetoric, that he, he relied on it to win his cases and it's also an emotionalism that, four years down the line, three and four years down the line, lent themselves perfectly well to the orthodoxies of the late 1960s, something we'll see in next week's reading, Eldridge Cleaver, Soul on Ice.

So his ideas were, you know, the, the, you know, the phrase is sort of nonsensical, you know, a person ahead of his time, the ideas that become popularized, that were popular when Malcolm X was alive, become popularized after his death, become the vehicle for establishing sort of a logic, organizational logic, for groups, that really don't even exist when Malcolm X is alive. Now martyrdom, certainly a major element of the Civil Rights Movement. In the time that remains, I want to actually segue from this Malcolm X biography and, because we have so much to cover on Wednesday, shift gears a little bit and start talking about events going backward over the last couple of years of Malcolm X's life, that spring from the, the phenomenon, the phenomena of martyrdom, what it does for people, or for a race in this case. This is an era of martyrdom, you have Kennedy assassinated, November 22nd, 1963. Then Johnson's now the President and calls for the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Act, something that was simmering on the table at the moment of John F. Kennedy's assassination. And Johnson commits himself for the rest of his time in office to fulfilling Kennedy's legacy on this agen--on this score. That's in sixty-three.

Little earlier than that, before Kennedy was assassinated--and this gets us to, if time permits, right to this moment of this, a sec--another martyrdom, the Students--Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC, starts working on voter registration drives and organizes with other, with other, gathers together with other organizations to have what's called a freedom vote, the fall of sixty-three. Plans are developed sixty-two for the fall of sixty-three, with the goal of proving one, that blacks are interested in voting. This is all happening in Mississippi, an important fact I just left out. I just remembered, sorry. The goal is to prove that blacks are interested in voting and to develop the practice for the eventual day when blacks in Mississippi might get the right to vote, helping develop the culture of voting for blacks in Mississippi. This turns into Freedom Summer, 1964. So now again we're back after King¡¯s assass--Kennedy's assassination.

The goal of the Freedom Summer of sixty-four is to organize a real party, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, to establish freedom schools throughout Mississippi, sites literally of training Mississippi youth the basics of education, literacy being one of the basic elements of freedom schools, but also creating community centers for poor blacks to come to get food, to get clothing, and also to develop a political consciousness about the future--about the present, thinking about the future. In June of sixty-four, June twentieth, first wave of recruits comes down to help make Freedom Summer a reality. It's people your age, people from Yale who are your age, are among the recruits, quite famously, a lot of them, coming from college campuses in the North and the Midwest and the West coast, coming to Mississippi to try to create real change in Mississippi, in, in Mississippi. On June twenty-first, the day after Mississippi Freedom Summer begins,  three workers disappear, Freedom Party workers. Andrew Goodman, a twenty-year-old from New York City, Michael Schwerner, a twenty-five-year-old from Brooklyn, and James Chaney, a twenty-one-year-old black Mississippian. Two white men and one black man.

They're arrested for speeding, a fairly common offense used by the police. Speeding, you know it didn't matter what speed you were actually going; they just arrested you for it. They were released that night, but understanding that, in Mississippi, they're dealing with infrastructure of police terror. The organizers for the meet--Mississippi Freedom Summer had a process that if you, if you get arrested at all, that you check in. If you're out in the field, you check in at normal intervals. Well, Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney did not check in at the appointed time, or within fifteen minutes of the appointed time. This sends out alarms. Compressing a lot of history here, but based on their disappearance, LBJ sends in sailors, Navy divers, to start drag--dredging swamps, looking for Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney. There's no doubt that they were killed. They've just go to find them now. What is quite horrific in the process of looking for Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney is that the divers don't find them, but they start pulling up other black bodies that had long gone missing in Mississippi and in other states.

Quite a state of affairs. During the summer, up in Washington, D.C., there's frantic attempts to organize the Congress, to break filibusters in the Senate, to get the Civil Rights bill signed into law. And on July 2nd, in 1964, Lyndon Johnson, Lyndon Johnson succeeds. It's the most far reaching Civil Rights bill in history at that point, and it gives the attorney general tremendous power. And the power, essentially, to enforce what is already on the books in many places. It provides for full access in places of public accommodation, establishes a permanent Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. It says there's going to be no discrimination in federally funded programs, something that really becomes important, I mean it's important immediately, but becomes part of the debate in the--up to our present day, in fact. Now the Civil Rights Act signed into law in July sixty-four, it's largely irrelevant to Mississippi blacks. Despite all the work of the Mississippi Freedom Summer activists, and their success at establishing the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, essentially an alternative to the Democratic Party in Mississippi, the fact is, the chance for blacks to actually vote through, quote, normal channels, official channels, is essentially nonexistent.

Still in the summer, Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney have been disappeared, the Civil Rights bill is passed but is meaningless to Mississippi. There are fights within Mississippi's state delegation, within the state government, about trying to silence the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. Democrats are heading towards a convention in August for the Democratic Party. The question is bubbling about what is going to happen in Mississippi, which group of delegates are going to be recognized. Will it be the official delegates of the Democratic Party in Mississippi or will it be the delegates of the Freedom Democratic Party?  LBJ is facing a threat that five other southern states would walk away if the Democratic Party--from the convention if the Democratic Party from Mississippi, the "official delegation," is not seated at the convention. And on August fourth, three weeks before the convention, the bodies of Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney are found in an earthen dam, near Philadelphia, Mississippi. Philadelphia, Mississippi.

The bodies are riddled with thirty-eight caliber bullets. Chaney, sole black man, his head is, I¡¯m sorry, his skull is fractured. He had suffered a savage beating. Mississippi law refused to allow the three men to be buried side by side, as they wished, as their families wished. Chaney had to be buried in a segregated cemetery. Eventually, twenty-one whites are arrested, including the deputy sheriff, all released by a state court. Eventually, six put on--into jail for violating federal civil rights laws, are given three to six years. David Dennis, the head of Mississippi's CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality, when asked to give a eulogy for James Chaney, agrees to do so and to give a calming eulogy. When he gets in front of the crowd, in this moment of profound emotional turmoil and political turmoil, wrestling with the martyrdom of these three men, he snaps and says something quite off the script, and that's exactly where we'll pick up on Wednesday.
Lecture 17 - From Voting Rights to Watts (continued) [March 24, 2010]
Chapter 1. Mississippi Freedom Summer [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  What I'd like to do today is go back very briefly so we're all on the same page, moving from events in 1964 through 1966 actually. I'm trying to compress some information so we can really be ready to catch next week right where we should be. Remember in the last lecture, I talked about the events leading up to this pivotal summer of 1964, John F. Kennedy's assassination, Lyndon Baines Johnson taking up the mantle of Kennedy's civil rights legis--legislation, the battles over the civil rights bill, a bill being essentially stuck in Congress, especially the Senate filibuster, student leaders from SNCC conceptualizing the idea for a Freedom Summer, freedom vote to train people how to become--how to fully embrace their rights as citizens in the state of Mississippi, setting up freedom schools. These things all come together in the summer of 1964.

Students from all around the country, Yale included, travel down to various points in Mississippi to begin Mississippi Freedom Democratic--Mississippi, Mississippi Freedom Summer, set up freedom schools, help organize votes to create a, a separate delegation to the Mississippi Democratic--to represent the Mississippi, Mississippi Democratic Party at the Democratic national convention in August. And the day after Mississippi Freedom Summer begins, three of the workers, Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney, disappear and are very quickly presumed to have been murdered. During the course of the summer, the Civil Rights Act of sixty--the Civil Rights Act is passed, signed into law, the most comprehensive law in support of racial equality in the nation's history. There was an immediate white backlash. George Wallace declares, the governor of Alabama, declares his candidacy. Ultimately has strong showings in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Maryland. Public places in the South go private in order to prevent integration. Civil Rights Act had not addressed the private institutions.

It's a long summer of riots in 1964. Riots aren't just in southern U.S. In fact, they're largely urban and northern: New York City; Rochester; Paterson, New Jersey; Elizabeth, New Jersey; Philadelphia; Chicago. It's a time of trial. And as you'll recall from my lecture on Monday as I was wrapping it up, weeks before the Democratic National Convention convenes, the bodies of Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney are found, August 4th. And they become martyrs of the movement, there's no doubt about it. It's really important that you know that they were found in Philadelphia, Mississippi, for reasons that become very important later on in this course. The bodies are found in an earthen dam in Philadelphia, Mississippi. There was an aspiration to have them buried together, but Mississippi state law said the races had to be buried in separate spaces.

David Dennis, the head of CORE in Mississippi, agrees to give a eulogy in honor of James Chaney, the sole African American of these, of these three people who were murdered. And he agrees to do it and then he sits down to do it and something happens. I want to play for you a clip. It's a three minute long clip. It's a little bit longer than I normally like to play, but you'll actually see the transformation happen during the course of the eulogy.

[Narrator:]  August 7th, 1964. The funeral of James Chaney in Meridien, Mississippi.

<<music plays>>

[David Dennis:]  I feel that he's got his freedom and we're still fighting for it. But what I want to talk about right now is the living dead that we have right among our midst, not only in the state of Mississippi, but throughout the nation. Those are the people who don't care, those who do care but don't have the guts enough to sign up for it, and those people who are busy up in Washington and other places using my freedom and my life to play politics with. That includes the President on down to the governor of the state of Mississippi. In my opinion, as I stand here, I not only blame the people who pulled the trigger or did the beating or dug the hole with the shovel, I bury the peace, but not up there with God. But I blame the people in Washington, D.C., and on down in the state of Mississippi for what happened just as much as I blame those who pulled the trigger. You see, I know what's going to happen. I feel that even if they find the people who killed those guys in the summertime, you got to come back to the state of Mississippi and have a jury, all their cousins, their aunts, their uncles. And I know what they're going to say, 'not guilty' because no one saw them pull the trigger. I'm tired of that. See, another thing that makes me even tireder, though, that is the fact that we as people here in the state and the country are allowing this to continue to happen, even us as black folk. So I look at the young kids here, that's something else that I grieve about. And little Ben Chaney here and the other ones like him around in this audience. Well if you want someone to babysit for your kids, hire a black mammy to hold your baby. And as long as he can do that, he can sit down beside me, he can watch me go up there and register to vote, and he can watch me take some <<inaudible>> in this state and he can sit down as I rule over him just as he's ruled over me for years. This is our country, too. We didn't ask to come here; they brought us over here.

Professor Jonathan Holloway: It's cut off at the last bit there, but he simply reiterates, "this is our country too."  Asked about this eulogy afterwards, Dave Dennis said he looked down--he was planning to abide by the rules and give sort of a calming and reassuring, mournful and certainly angry, but in a polite sort of way, mournful eulogy. And he looked down at Ben Chaney and he just snapped, "because I can't do this any longer."  What you see happening in sixty-four and you'll see more in sixty-five as well, is a fundamental shift in the tone of the movement. This is really one of the most important things to understand about this moment in the movement's history. You also see in the wake of great triumphs of the movement, like the Civil Rights Act being signed--there's no mistaking it's a triumph--you also see a very clear tactical shift in the movement, and that's what this lecture really is about, the fundamental tone and tactical changes in the movement that happened in the, in the sixty-four, sixty-five moment.

From the standpoint of tactics, it's clear to Johnson and to others--Lyndon Johnson and to others--that by signing in the Civil Rights Act, he was kissing away the Democratic Party in the South. This is the, this is the real fear. And the only Democrats who were going to vote for him were African American Democrats. From the highest levels of political government, organized government, the notion is, "you've got to get these black folks registered."  Well, as it happened--at least for the Democratic Party. On the ground, that's the agenda as well for people in Mississippi, people who were working on Mississippi Freedom Summer and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. So the Freedom--MFDP, Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, an attempt by white and black activists in Mississippi, with support from other places, to set up a slate of candidates to run as the alternate to the Mississippi Democratic delegation, that would ultimately be seated at the, at the Democratic National Convention.

The vice chair of the MFDP, a very famous activist named Fannie Lou Hamer. Fannie Lou Hamer was the youngest of twenty children, sharecropper all of her life, no education after the third grade, but had powerful presence, incredibly eloquent, captivating speaker. And sadly, part of what made her so captivating is the story she had to tell was nightmarish. When I say that, you know, she was in school to the third grade, the schools were only open for three or four months, because the rest of the time you were working in the fields. Well, as other SNCC activists and SCLC activists come to, to Mississippi, they meet this  person they've been hearing about, Ms. Hamer, and she begins to be inspired by them and starts to try to organize voters on her own. She's harassed by the police. People would call all day and night on her home telephone number to the point she had to just take the phone off the receiver. Threats with her losing her job, threats against her life, but she's unfazed. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party is more than just her, but she embodies so much of it.

As they're marching to the Democratic National Convention, the debate is which Democratic delegation will the national Democratic leadership accept?  MFDP insists that they're going to be the party to be recognized. Democratic established leadership said, "That's just not going to happen."  Southern delegations in other states threaten to walk if Lyndon Johnson, Democratic National Committee admit or--yeah, admit--MFDP to the floor of the convention. Johnson's already afraid of losing the South and now this is confirmation. And these were states that are already leaning towards Barry Goldwater anyway, the Republican candidate.

Anyway, the convention arrives and Fannie Lou Hamer goes to the credentials committee, representing the MFDP, and starts to talk with them about why the MFDP needs to be recognized as the proper delegation. This is the committee that's setting the rules for the conference, for the convention. And her statement is captured on live TV. This is when you'd have what, what is it called?  Gavel to gavel cover--coverage of conventions and such. And she starts telling a story about her efforts to organize people to exercise their full civil rights just to vote, get them to register to vote, and being arrested by the police, being taken to jail. And while she's in jail for breaking no law, they put--the jailors stand by and get two black inmates, bring them over and threaten them with further punishment if they did not beat Fannie Lou Hamer, and they beat her senseless. She survives the beating, she survives it, but is physically, permanently damaged from the beating. This is what being a citizen meant if you're an African American activist in Mississippi. Could end up like James Chaney, could be beaten to an inch of your life like Fannie Lou Hamer, certainly sending signals to the rest of black Mississippians.

Well, while Hamer is giving this testimony to the credentials committee, Lyndon Johnson, still in Washington, D.C., at the White House, hears about it, knows it's going out live and is furious, and immediately calls a press conference trying--[student sneezes] Bless you--trying to simply distract the media from what's now airing over the country. Just a trumped up news conference. He had nothing to actually talk about. A lot of the cameras stay with Hamer, but Johnson recognizes that he's losing grip of retaining any, any hope of keeping the white South. He asks his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, to get Walter Mondale to coordinate this resolution to a dispute, and the resolution says that the Mississippi--Mississippi delegation, the Democratic delegation, Democratic Party would be seated if they swore allegiance to Johnson's civil rights platform. But--And in addition to that, two delegates from the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party would also join the Mississippi Democratic delegation.

All but three of the Mississippi Democratic Party delegates, the "formally" elected delegates--this is an all-white, all-white party in Mississippi, I should have said in the beginning--all but three of the Mississippi delegates bolt, and the MFDP refuses to compromise. "You either seat all of us or none of us."  The Democratic Party National Convention ultimately recognizes just three of the delegates from Mississippi who didn't leave. The rest of the Mississippi delegation votes for Barry Goldwater. The MF--the, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegates ultimately vote for LBJ. There's no logical choice, frankly, between LBJ or Goldwater, as far as their actions were concerned. Johnson, of course, goes ahead and gets re-elected, or gets elected, I guess, for the first time in a landslide, but he loses five states in his native South. The states that were threatening to bolt if he caved in to the MFDP came through. He might have lost them anyway, but it becomes very, very clear to Johnson at this point, to any Democratic activist, that the black vote is now critical in the South, if there's any hope to hang onto a Democratic presence.


Chapter 2. Martin Luther King, Jr Advocates a New Voter Registration Drive [00:15:55]

So this is the end of the summer in 1964. Civil Rights Act is there, but the question of the vote is unresolved. Civil Rights Act does not address voting. Right away, activists on the ground and those at the highest reaches of the federal government, Democratic Party at least, hone in on voting. This is the next, this is the next challenge. Meanwhile, Martin Luther King is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He goes to Oslo to receive it, and he returns in January of sixty-five to participate in this next wave of challenges, the vote. He goes--In January of sixty-five he goes to Selma, Alabama, Dallas County, Selma, Alabama, and he announces a new SCLC initiative to register people to vote. The sheriff in the county, a guy named James Clark, was much like--oh my goodness--our favorite punch--punching bag from Birmingham.

Students:  <<inaudible>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Ah, you guys were paying attention. Thank you, Bull Connor--much like Bull Connor. So he's, he¡¯s pulling out cattle prods, clubs and tear gas to break up crowds. I mean he is ripe for becoming a target of national media coverage. The situation in Selma is really quite astonishing--in, in Dallas County, I should say, not Selma. The larger district. In Dallas County, out of fifteen thousand people who are registered to vote, only three hundred and thirty-five of them are black. Now if you don't know Alabama, it's important to understand, it is a state with, in many places, a majority black population, and in all places, a significant black population. So in Dallas County, there is no black voting presence. In Alabama in general, seventy-seven percent, over three quarters of eligible blacks, are still off the voting rolls. It's a much higher percentage than what you see in other places, other southern--throughout the South in general.

So King goes down there to announce a new voter registration drive, knowing that the sheriff would be one he could bait pretty easily. Rallies are organized, marches are planned. Middle of February, peaceful SCLC rally in a neighboring, neighboring area was attacked by the police. The city police, the county police and the state police. And during the melee, one of the people involved in the rally, a twenty-six year-old named Jimmie Lee Jackson, according to witnesses, shields his mother who's in the process of getting beaten by a state trooper, and he's shot in the stomach and dies. Now the police account of what happened is different, as one would expect, but the fact of the matter is, he's shot in the stomach, and he dies. Guaranteeing¡ªI mean this would be horrible enough as it is, and one would hope gather attention, but what guaranteed gathering the attention to this fact is that news cameras were there. And in the, in the confusion of the rally being broken up by the police, several reporters from NBC are injured. Essentially attacked, hit--they get beaten up by the police as well. Guarantees national coverage.

A plan evolves immediately to march from Selma, where Jimmie Lee Jackson was murdered, from Selma to Montgomery, the state capital, fifty miles away. The original plan was to take Jimmie Lee's body along this path and leave him at the state house stairs. And, very quickly, saner heads prevail. This is disrespectful to the body, of course. But the fact is the plan for a march from Selma to Montgomery is hatched. On March 7th, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, John Lewis, begins a march across--begins the march from Selma to Montgomery. He's leading in single file order, maybe two or three across, six hundred protesters over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It's very important to know that Martin Luther King was not there, even though he knows about the plans. This is the march.

[Narrator:] We on the other side were Alabama state troopers, under orders from Governor Wallace to stop the marchers.

<<inaudible dialog>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Oh, I hit it a second too late. You can see right here in the fading out, that's John Lewis, now Representative John Lewis, in the tan trench coat.

[Narrator:]  <<inaudible>> was on the sideline.

[Man: ] <<inaudible>> to your safety from being in this march and I'm <<inaudible>>  this as an unlawful offenses. You are to disperse. You are ordered to disperse. Go home or go to your church. This march will not continue. Is that clear to you? I've got nothing further to say to you. <<inaudible>> <<shouting and screaming>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Tear gas canisters.

[video continues]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  The march, the disruption of the march, is captured on live TV, of course, and shown across the nation, leading people to ask the same question that Fannie Lou Hamer asked when she was giving her testimony to the credentials committee: is this America?  Thousands flocked to Selma as a protest was announced, "We will march again" from across the country, black, white, doesn't matter. They all come to Selma to right this injustice. This day becomes known as "Bloody Sunday."  Two days later, King is there, and they're going to march a second time. And this is a pattern that has grown to become quite irritating to a lot of activists on the ground, is that King, for all of his incredible charisma and power, is never right--really quite there at the moment of crisis. His presence creates a new moment of crisis, no doubt about it, but he wasn't there getting beaten on Bloody Sunday. And this is a tension that has been there in the movement for years already, that when King arrives, the cameras show up; when he leaves, the cameras leave. In this case, the cameras were already there.

There's a federal order banning the march, wanting a cool down period. King goes, "We're going to have a march anyway."  A bold statement. So on Tuesday, March 9th, King leads a much larger group of activists across the Edmund Pettus bridge and starts the march to Montgomery. This is not the famous march though. Crosses the bridge, the police are there like they were the last time. They tell him to turn around, the same script. "Go back to your churches" and whatnot. King asks, asks his followers to kneel and pray along with him and then, in a complete shock to those SNCC leaders who are still beaten and bloody from two days earlier, King tells them to go back to their churches. This is not what they had bargained for. They were going to press forward and do this all over again. More horrified to discover that King had negotiated--to keep the peace and respect the federal order, King had quietly negotiated this whole performance, so the police knew that if King stuck to his script, he would kneel and tell his flock to pray, you know, create the visual moment, and then disperse peacefully.

SNCC leaders had no idea about this. They--so King came in and took their march, hijacked it, turned it into his circus, and then they didn't even get to press forward to honor Jimmie Lee Jackson's life. This is a very important moment in the movement. Not one that is--it's not triumphed as the march, the eventual march to Montgomery that happens two weeks later, under incredible federal protection by the way. The slight cracks and fractures and fissures that were there between SNCC and SCLC--remember SNCC being organized under SCLC's umbrella just five years ago at that point¡ªthe, the cracks are now wide open. And SNCC would no longer see itself as being part of SCLC's organizing logic. And SNCC would no longer kowtow to King's declarations. They are truly--it is truly its own organization, and as we'll soon see, takes off on its own path.

So the march does proceed in--on the twenty-first. What's that, forty-five years ago and a, and a few days. But the real drama in many ways, for the movement's sake, is the drama that happens in the two attempts prior to that. So the issue is voting registration. This is what these rallies were about that where Jimmie Lee Jackson had been murdered. This is what the vote to Montgomery is, is all about recognizing the fact that African Americans still don't have access to the ballot box. Meanwhile, a voting rights bill is bouncing around Congress, and Lyndon Johnson keeps upping the stakes, and, and in many ways throwing his presidency in harm's way. He declares between the Tuesday turnaround march and the eventual march, he goes to joint session of Congress and astonishes Congress by quoting one of the famous lines of the movement. He says, you know, he's basically saying, "As a nation, we cannot abide by treating our own citizens this way. Their struggle is our struggle and we shall overcome."  It's an astonishing moment, presidential rhetoric, Lyndon Johnson saying it.

In June of the same year, sixty-five, at Howard University's graduate--graduation ceremony, Howard being the most important, largest historically black college and university, essentially mostly funded by the federal government, Johnson at the graduation ceremony says the following:

"You do not--[coughs] excuse me¡ªYou do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying, 'Now you are free to go where you want, do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please.' You do not take a man who, for years, has been hobbled by chains, liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race saying, 'You are free to compete with all the others,' and still believe that you have been completely fair. This is the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil rights. We seek not just freedom, but opportunity; not just legal equity, but human ability; not just equality as a right and a theory, but equality as a fact and as a result."

This is part of LBJ rolling out affirmative action, sort of testing the waters essentially. But very quickly, affirmative action policies now become woven into federal policies as well. In fact, women who have been the greatest beneficiaries of affirmative action, something I'll probably say again in about three or four weeks, were not covered under the original umbrella of affirmative action. It was actually only added two years later and added by someone who was hostile to the whole idea. He thought, "My god, if we just add women to this thing, we'll sink the whole program," and people went along with it. He¡¯s like, "Oh, I misjudged that one." 


Chapter 3. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 [00:31:07]

Anyway, back to the summer of sixty-five, Johnson is going out on a limb, essentially, making clear he is going to be the civil rights presidency. Now he's a president, president, and many other things as well, but he's definitely the civil rights president. On August 6th of 1965, he signs the Voting Rights Act, an incredible effort to get it through. And the Voting Rights Act prohibited states from imposing literacy requirements as obstacles for accessing the ballot box. It's the most successful way of cutting out the vote. And, most importantly, and this is the most important element, it allowed the attorney general to send federal examiners in, into any election where they thought voting rights might be curtailed.

The Voting Rights Act, just to make clear¡ªand some of you may get--I mean I get, I get this email about once a year, or once every other year, that the Voting Rights Act is coming up before Congress and it¡¯s gonna--they might not approve it, and they'll end the right to vote for African Americans. My father sent it to me once, which drove me crazy. I'm like, "Dad, you know better than this."  The fact is, the Voting Rights Act does not give anybody the right to vote. It gives the federal government the authority to protect the right to vote. It brings into bold relief the federal government's ability and right to supersede in local affairs, which has been the, the nut of the, the bone of contention since the Voting Rights Act was passed.

The Voting Rights Act has, if you look forward from the moment of its passage in August sixty-five, makes a clear change. Within four years of its passage, three-fifths of adult blacks are registered to vote. It's an astonishing shift. Between 1964 and sixty-nine, roughly the same period we're talking about here, the number of registered black voters goes from, in Alabama, less than twenty percent of the population to over sixty percent of the population. In Mississippi, it goes to less than seven percent of the population to over two-thirds of the population, within five years. It's a seismic shift, especially when you consider the number--the numbers we're talking about in terms of the African American population. So there's no disputing the fact the Voting Rights Act has a, a, a significant effect, as you look forward, the crystal ball, three or four, five years from the moment of its signing. It's also clear the Voting Rights Act had astonishingly no effect in the immediate moment, in those places where blacks already had the right to vote. And this was made very clear, five days later, when the Watts community in Los Angeles goes up in flames.

A few words about Watts. It's a riot in the, if you know Los Angeles demography, in a portion of the city that is due south of central Los Angeles, a place that had been the home for the longest, for, for a couple of decades in the wake of the Second Great Migration, World War II, where black Los Angeles was overwhelmingly found. It was not a wealthy part of the city, not by any stretch. But people had the kinds of civil rights, citizenship rights they wouldn't have had, African Americans, they wouldn't have had in Mississippi or Alabama or Georgia. They also had, visually, a better quality of life than those people who are stuck in high rise slums in Chicago and New York City. There's green spaces. There¡¯s, well maybe they're not homeowners, but their homes, were living in homes. They aren't in high rises, certainly. There's sunshine, for goodness' sakes, there's palm trees. But the fact is, there is incredible economic degradation, powerful sense of hopelessness, and a real feeling that you were not a citizen, even though you could, could vote. But it really had no great benefit to you.

So in Watts, the flashpoint revolves around an arrest that goes bad. Marquette Frye, an African American man living in that neighborhood, is stopped by the California Highway Patrol at night. He'd been drinking with his older brother. Cops pulled him over and they're about to let him go, when another--this is Marquette Frye's version--when another more belligerent crew of California Highway Patrol officers arrive. Frye's mother arrives, wanting to know what's going on, trying to get her son. And these new belligerent cops assault the mother. Frye is hit by a police officer as he is trying to protect his mother, thrown into a police car, sent off. The police version is rather different. Drunken driver, they pull Frye over, radio for assistance. Other police arrive. Meanwhile, a crowd arrives of citizens and residents of the area. Marquette Frye makes a play for one of the police officers' guns, and they start wrestling with him, throw him in a car. And, immediately, the crowd that's gathered around, a crowd that had been worn out by police brutality, historic police brutality in that area, city, the crowd starts to explode.

What happens, ultimately, is that thirty-four people die the next handful of days. Over a thousand people are injured; four thousand are arrested; property damage in excess of two hundred million, which was a ton of money in 1965 if you think about it; damage ranging across a forty-six mile, square mile area, larger than Manhattan or San Francisco. Thirty-five thousand adults are deemed, quote, active rioters. Seventy-two thousand are deemed close spectators. And what, why this is important in the reports that follow is that the police are going in intermittently. It's just one big logistics mess. Police are going in now and again to try to calm things down. The riot would be sporadic. There'd be a hot point over here, a fire would be started over there, or a fake fire alarm would be called, and police would go over there. The fire department would be called to a scene and then, and then they'd be showered with bottles and bricks and then snipers. It was an urban battle zone.

So a lot of people were active as rioters who never, you know, see justice, according to the police, because they're the ones shooting from windows the police can never get to, for instance. Ultimately, sixteen thousand National Guard, LAPD, and California Highway Patrol officers are brought in. They militarize the zone in order to re-establish the peace. It's a massive property riot. Food, stores that sell food, liquor stores, furniture stores, clothing stores are destroyed, especially those owned by middle- and upper-class whites. Churches, homes and libraries are relatively untouched. And I say this just to--you know some people will talk about whites--Watts as a mindless insurrection. I'm not defending the riot at any--to any extent, but it wasn't mindless. Certainly something tactical by going after those institutions that the residents thought were keeping them down. Store owners who were black would write up, you know, "soul brother" in their window to prevent their store from being attacked. Now some of them got attacked anyway, because there's certainly going to be some level of chaos in any kind of riot. But often they were passed over.

For white America, all of this happens completely out of the blue. After all, Lyndon Baines Johnson has just signed in the Voting Rights Act. "What else do you people want?" is essentially the mentality. "What else could you want?"  And what L.A. shows is that there are deep and fundamental problems, that the Civil Rights Movement, as far as its most famous rhetoric, you know, the right to vote, you know, the right to go, go into the front door of a bus--a restaurant, ride in a bus where you want to¡ªL.A. had all those things already. It didn't point to more fundamental economic problems. That's what Watts was about.

Now Watts, now whether the riot--I'm not going to play counter factual history: would the riot have happened if this or that hadn't happened?  I, I don¡¯t know. But what is clear is that just as people are struggling with this new tactical change in the movement, got to pursue the black vote, people are clearly struggling with a shift in tone. The kind of militancy and armed militancy that you see happening in Watts is becoming more recognizable and more frequent. Part of it grows out of the rhetoric, no doubt, of Malcolm X, even after he disavowed a lot of the rhetoric. This becomes very clear in next week's reading. And part of it is--Part of it's growing out of an increasing U.S. military occupation in this strange place they haven't quite figured out yet called Vietnam, and people coming home from Vietnam with a different sense of how to pursue justice. There's a fundamental shift in tone and you see it embodied in Watts, profound impatience.

Now impatience is not just an urban or western and northern phenomenon. It's an impatience that's in the, in the heart of, quote, the movement as well, in the southeastern United States. Blacks are increasingly happy about, or impatient and frustrated with, the client-patron relationship in the South, and throughout the country really. And we'll see, we¡¯ll see next week, when we start talking about the Black Panther Party, how it becomes articulated in Oakland, California. It's most famously the Black Panther Party. But it's important to take a moment to talk about the first Black Panther Party in the context of shift and tones. [computer beeps] Oh, that's my--I have something happening soon, I guess, my computer telling me I have to go. So let's look at the first Black Panther Party.

You have the march from Selma to Montgomery, the, the famous march. So much of the political rhetoric talks about how--or historical rhetoric, it goes off without a hitch, incredible federal protection. But a hallmark to how great we are as a country because of how peaceful it was. It wasn't so peaceful to everybody. One of the activists who came down to Selma to help out, a woman named Vi--Viola Liuzzo from Michigan, her job was working support for the march. And her job was to, in her car, ferry people back from Montgomery, from Montgomery back to Selma. She happens to be driving her car with some of the marchers in it, driving through Lowndes County, Alabama. A car pulls up next to her, rolls down the window, pulls out a shotgun, blows her away.

A young man named Stokely Carmichael, northerner raised in the, in New York City, graduated from Howard University, goes down to participate in the Freedom Summer, rises to the leadership circle in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, he¡¯s sent--Stokely Carmichael is sent to Lowndes County to figure out what the heck is going on in this place. Trying to organize the black vote, partly in honor of Liuzzo's assassination. What he finds in Lowndes is a population that is a predominantly black population, eighty-one percent black. It's a black county. Black citizens of Lowndes were poor, they were landless, and economically dependent on a small, white, elite planter society. It's apartheid. Blacks outnumbered whites overwhelmingly, eighty-one percent, but they were not registered to vote, and they actually feared civil rights agitation. It's like, "What are you doing coming in here?  Our life is horrible, but you're going to get us killed." 

As Carmichael digs a little deeper in Lowndes, he finds, finds a different current though, and he just discovers that trying to register black Lowndes County citizens to vote in the Democratic Party is something he's really not going to have much success doing. There's such hostility and such hopelessness. But he also discovers a level of militancy there as well. So they form their own party, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, the LCFO. The Lowndes County Freedom Organization. And it has as its goal running candidates, developing a platform, becoming a recognized party, an alternative to the Democratic Party, which had no relevance to black Mississippians living in Lowndes County. And the LCFO chooses as its mascot the black panther. And the logic was, LCFO leaders talked about the black panther as an animal that retreats when it's pursued, until it's backed into a corner, and then it springs forth with a life or death battle on its mind. And that's how the Lowndes County farmers, they're all farmers, felt. And importantly, they were armed. I mean, and this is no big deal. I mean, farmers in the South, everybody was armed. You shot your meals often. The party was armed, and it was uninterested in working with whites. Whites who sympathized, who wanted to help them, it's like, "No, forget it."  And this group, as we'll see next week, becomes the inspiration for the famous Black Panther Party.

Now very quickly, by this point, sixty-five, SNCC had, you know, is breaking apart from SCLC. It becomes affiliated with the, sort of the rising new left, the radical student organizations. It's exploring other ideological options, instead it¡¯s, it¡¯s of what was then certainly radical in 1960, you know, integrating lunch counters, integrating places of, of, of commerce. SNCC links up with the Students for Democratic Society, SDS, for a while, but the racial politics become too complex, because SNCC leaders felt the whites were trying to take control of SDS, black leaders in SNCC. In January of 1966, Samuel Young, a twenty year-old Navy vet, African American, recruited by SNCC to be an organizer in Tuskegee, he's killed for using a white bathroom. At that point, SNCC comes out against the war in Vietnam and, in doing so, isolates itself from mainstream civil rights organizations. Another major break in the fabric, rip in the fabric. In the wake of this, the Atlanta cell within SNCC, which is increase--increasingly radical, starts getting racially restless. In the spring of sixty-six, Stokely Carmichael, essentially now the leader of SNCC, produces a position paper that says:

"White participation, as practiced in the past, is now obsolete. If we are to proceed toward true liberation, we must cut ourselves off from white people. We must form our own institutions, write our own histories."

"White participation, as practiced in the past, is now obsolete."  Stokely Carmichael is now the chair of SNCC. Whites are now kicked out of the movement. I'm going to stop right there, but we are literally, quite literally, at the cusp of the famous articulation of Black Power. Certainly all the pieces are now in place, and the movement, the famous movement that we've all been taught about in our little grade books and stuff, begins its very quick descent into completely splintering apart. Those are the events from sixty-four to sixty-six. We'll pick up from there, at there on Monday.
Lecture 18 - Black Power [March 29, 2010]
Chapter 1. Introduction [00:00:00]

<<music playing>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  I think maybe I just wanted to be a DJ in another life. I just like playing clips. The--So this is an excerpt from James Brown's Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud. It's released in 1968. You know, we aren't quite there chronologically yet. I'll be coming, coming up to it in the course of the lecture though. And it becomes an immediate hit, a popular hit, and a political hit. It's played at rallies to rev up the crowd and call and response, certainly. Brown actually distances himself from the song after a handful of years, saying, "Look, we needed it at that moment. We needed it to develop pride in the black community to understand who we were as a people, but, you know, things are more complicated now."  This is something he's saying in the 1970s, as his politics start going off in, in a variety of different directions. But we are at this moment, for the purpose of today's lecture, essentially sixty-six through the end of the six--through the end of the decade. We're at this moment of profound fascination with blackness in a different, in a different kind of way. It's being articulated in different ways than it was at the moment of SCLC¡¯s being established or SNCC's establishment. We're at a moment of incred--sort of in the wake of incredible successes with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, a moment of incredible ambiguity: what are we going to be doing next?; what's the next step in the journey?; and a moment of profound rupture. I already talked a little bit about this last week with--calling attention to a tone shift and a strategic shift as far as black freedom movements are concerned in the late--mid to late 1960s, and we'll deal with it a little more explicitly today. One more clip, this one a video clip, as a way to get another, well as a way to get more traction on what's happening in this particular moment. It's a very short one.

[Narrator:] Eldridge Cleaver, who had gained fame from his writings in prison was the chief spokesman for the party.

[Eldridge Cleaver:] We feel that the police must be brought under control by any means necessary, including through force of arms, and we have never bit our tongue about that. We say it now, loud and clear, we will always say it and we're not afraid to say it, that the racist Gestapo pigs have to stop brutalizing our community, or we're going to take up guns, we're going to drive them out.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  I think he made his point rather clear. This is a period of also incredible rhetorical hyperbole. I mean, I'm not saying that he didn't mean these things certainly, but, but the, the scope of what's actually going to happen, the violence and the rhetoric, is palpable and we are certainly past that moment of the beloved community, with Martin Luther King and his dream in 1963. And we'll talk, depending on how far I get in today's lecture, might start talking about King's final years today, or we'll certainly pick it up on Wednesday. But you'll see the unraveling of this beloved community, especially when we start talking about King.

Now you saw a clip there about Eldridge Cleaver, Minister--Minister of Information for the Black Panther Party. Let's back up a few steps, overlapping where we were last Wednesday, make sure we're all on the same page about the Black Panther Party's establishment in this moment of the Black--the Black Power moment in general. You remember that I talked about the Lowndes County Freedom Organization in, in Alabama, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, the first group to embrace the black panther as a symbol. Stokely Carmichael, a veteran of Mississippi Freedom Summers and freedom schools, just out of college essentially, SNCC activists--activist, goes down to Lowndes County where he discovers these farmers and helps them organize into the LCFO. Becomes a radicalizing moment for Carmichael, one that is on sort of a steady pace for him, one radicalizing moment after another, that eventually leads to his exile from the United States in just a handful of years.


Chapter 2. James Meredith, Stokely Carmichael and the March against Fear [00:05:08]

So we're in 1966. James Meredith, young man, a civil rights activist who had integrated Old Miss, the University of Mississippi, the bastion of state privilege in that particular state. If you wanted to become a leader in Mississippi, you went to Old Miss, and this was a place that was unavailable to African Americans, and James Meredith wanted to change that. He integrates Old Miss a few years earlier, and in the process, residents of the area riot and actually kill federal marshals who are there to, you know, ensure the place gets integrated. James Meredith is an iconoclastic character if ever there was one, and actually comes out very much against civil rights later on in his life, saying it was demeaning that we, that African Americans had to still cling to these notions of civil rights heritage and battles. James Meredith decides that he wants to call attention to the changes in Mississippi that have been very real, certainly, and he decides he's going to march across Mississippi in June of sixty-six, a march against fear. "No one's going to tell me what to do. No one's in control of my life."  He's marching by himself.

Civil rights leaders, people on the ground, friends of the movement, are el--all telling Meredith, "This is crazy. You cannot do this. Okay, you've done a lot of great things for the movement, but the idea of actually trying to march across Mississippi by yourself without, without protection is a suicide mission."  It turns out they're almost right. Meredith starts off on his march and before you know it, he's laid flat by shots, someone driving by with a shotgun. He's hospitalized. He survives, of course, he¡¯s--but, but it's not clear at that moment what's actually going to happen. Leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SCLC, CORE decide, "Well we¡¯re not going to let--Now we're not going to let this march fail."  So they set out to complete Meredith's march against fear, so they're going to march across the state. At a stop in Greenwood, Mississippi, Stokely Carmichael, now the leader of SNCC, been thrown in jail for I think the eighth time, I believe. They'd done the jail no bail strategies. The march is still going on. Stokely Carmichael gets out of jail and tells an assembly out on the lawns, "The only way"--excuse me.

"The only way we're going to stop them white men from whipping us is to take over. We've been saying 'Freedom' for six years, and we ain't got nothing. What we're going to start saying now is 'Black Power.'"

And it's call and response. You know, "What do you want?"  "Black Power!"  "What do you want?"  "Black Power!" starts going through the audience. Now Carmichael wasn't the first to start calling for Black Power, using that phrase, but he popularizes it, and so it becomes attached him. People had been ruminating over that phrase and sort of throwing it around for months at that point, but this is one of these sort of lightning flash moments, where it captures the national attention and also scares the nation. King heartily disapproves. It's like, this kind of, you know, calling for this kind of militancy is misplaced. The country is at sea, and we're going to alienate all those people who might be fellow travelers in this journey with us, by this kind of--with this kind of anger. I mean sure, we can be angry, but this is not the path.

So you take together the Lowndes County Freedom Organization and its rising profile, Stokely Carmichael being on the ground there, Stokely Carmichael and others taking up the march against fear after James Meredith has been shot. Carmichael essentially snapping, saying, "The hell with this!  You know, trying to do things through the system is only getting people shot without retribution. We need Black Power. We need to stand up on our own." You remember whites had been now thrown out of SNCC. They no longer have a place in the movement.


Chapter 3. The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense [00:09:39]

In October of that same year, two college students at Merit College in Oakland, California, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, formed the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. They'd been hearing about the LCFO, thought it was a fantastic idea. They'd been seeing this radicalizing moment happening in SNCC, and they say, You know, "It's time for us to take our stand on our own terms. We need to embrace Black Power as well."  Huey Newton declares himself the Minister of Defense of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, and Bobby Seale is its chairman. And I just realized, [laughs] I left what I was going to read at home. Anyway, it's a good thing it's in your reader.

The, the, at the moment of their founding, the issue of the Black Panther Party platform, it's a couple of pages long in your reader. I can't read the points I was going to read, but the fact is essentially this. I want you to look at that particular document, and look at the kind of things that the platform is calling for. It's calling for the kinds of fundamentals, for lack of a better phrase, that I've been calling your attention to from other freedom organizations since the Niagara Movement in 1905. Now it's calling for more than that, of course, but it's still calling for fundamentals. This is the state of the conversation. It seems to not have changed in some ways. Now it has changed in the sense that the Black Panther Party is, through, through the, the platform, and then what you're going to see later in the Executive Mandate Number One, talking about in a few moments here, is connecting African American freedom struggles to what's happening on a global scale.

It's clearly Marxist in its ideology, in its political--it's, it¡¯s understanding of political economy. It's viewing its struggle in the light of what it considers United States imperialism in places like Vietnam. It's being motivated by the kinds of militancy that you see black soldiers coming home from yet another war, still being denied their citizenship, but now the ground has shifted enough that they can articulate themselves in a different way that, that is calling for armed self-defense. It's not about, you know, trying to get in the front door of a bus or the front door of a restaurant. It's about something much larger than that, about being a global citizen. Well, as the Panther Party is organizing itself and delineating in the, in the program, in the platform the ways it shall be organized--no you're not going to drink, you're not going to do drugs, you're going to, you know, be respectful in all different manners of life, and whether they succeeded in that or not is a whole other kind of conversation.

The Panthers start looking for a way to grow, and they hear about this guy named Eldridge Cleaver. Eldridge Cleaver, thrown in jail--I¡¯m sorry. My notes seem to be all over the place today. It's fascinating--thrown in jail and then writes this book Soul on Ice?, and becomes, you know, is incredible--incredibly charismatic and quite brilliant as well. The Panthers realize they can actually tap into Eldridge Cleaver and his charisma, and they use him as the Minister of Information. That's how you saw him speaking to the public in his position as the Minister of Information, trying to spread the narrative of what the Panthers were all about. Now the popular notion of the Panthers is highly masculine, these young men representing the, you know, manhood of the race, they're very virile. They've got their black leather jackets, they've got the berets, their turtlenecks, very fashionable. There are some women in the Panthers as well, but, you know, where they fit into the movement at the early stage is really a little bit unclear. Panthers are armed. They're going to take back the streets under their own terms and take control away from the "racist pigs" as they refer to the cops.

The Panthers would do--the bases they were in Oak--in Oakland at their founding--decided to take control of that community first, and very contro--controversially, one of the tactics they decided to pursue is monitoring the police. Just as you see people in Los Angeles in, at the flashpoint of the L.A.--the Watts riots, excuse me, people frustrated by the years of police brutality, unmarked, unchecked police brutality; Oakland residents felt the same way. And so the Panthers start to patrol the police, it¡¯s the famous Panther Patrols. They studied the California laws to the letter, and they knew that they had a right to carry guns, and they knew that they had a right to watch the police. And they knew that if the police arrested somebody, they could stand witness, as long as they kept say twenty or thirty feet, I don't know the distance. As long as they kept distance--the proper distance from the police, they could observe everything that's happening.

Now as you can imagine, if you're a police officer, whether you are a racist pig of an officer or not, you're not going to be too thrilled about angry men with guns following you around when you arrest somebody, whether they deserve to be arrested or not. You're not going to be too happy about that, because the guns are loaded. It creates incredible friction, and creates a crisis at the state capital. The Panthers--the state legislature, very unhappy about these Panther Patrols, entertains a bill that makes it illegal to carry weapons in urban districts. Well, the Panthers were exclusively urban. Now it didn't mention race, didn't mention the Panthers, but it clearly was targeting the Panthers, trying to kill these Panther Patrols. So the Panthers decide to go up to Sacramento, the state capital, and challenge the bill, and while they're there, something of a circus happens. I want to play to you--for you a clip of that circus.

[NARRATOR:] The boldness of the Panther actions attracted young blacks, many in their teens. Carrying loaded firearms in public was a well protected legal right in California. But with the emergence of the Black Panthers, state officials introduced legislation to outlaw carrying loaded firearms within city limits. May 1967, in protest the Panthers traveled to Sacramento, the state capital.

[BOBBY SEALE: ]We arrived there, all these black men and women, twenty-four males and six females, with guns and Ronald Reagan, then the governor, was on the lawn with two hundred future leaders of America, you know, twelve and thirteen and fourteen year old kids. And these kids started leaving this session on the lawn and coming to see us. And these young white kids thought we were a gun club.

[NARRATOR:] Knowing the media would be there, the group of men and women then entered the capitol building.

[REPORTER:] They're heavily armed, whether their weapons are loaded or not, nobody seems to know.

[MAN 1:] Wait a minute. Am I under arrest? Am I under arrest? Am I under arrest? Am I?  Get your hands off me if I'm not under arrest. If I'm under arrest, I'll come. if I'm not don't put your hands on me.

[MAN 2:]  Is this the way the racist government works? Don't let a man exercise his constitutional rights? I'd like to make a statement now with this respect. Statement of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. On the Mulford Act now pending before the California legislature, the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense calls upon the American people in general and the black people in particular, to take full note of the racist California legislature which is now considering legislation aimed at keeping the black people disarmed and powerless at the very same time that racist police agencies throughout the country are intensifying the terror, brutality, murder and repression of black people.

[NARRATOR:] A nation that had grown used to the nonviolent civil rights movement was now confronted with new images of black protest. Later, at a Sacramento service station, news cameras documented the continuing debate over law and gun.

[PANTHER:] Ain't no sawed off, that's a ride shotgun, just like yours.

[BOBBY HUTTON:] Do you all know the constitutional rights?

[POLICE OFFICER:] Sure we do. We're well aware of the constitutional right --

[BOBBY HUTTON:] You have no right to take my gun away from me. You breaking the constitutional rights.

[REPORTER:] The pamphlet says that the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense calls on the American people in general to take careful note of the racist California legislature. Why do you believe the legislature is racist?

[EMORY DOUGLAS:] Don't you know? You're a part of it and obviously this is a white system. This is obviously where we at.

[REPORTER:] Do you believe everything that's in that pamphlet?

[EMORY DOUGLAS:] The pamphlet speaks for itself.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  As you see, people didn't know what to make of these young men and young women. The Panthers go national immediately following this run in at the state capital. People are attracted to the charisma of its representatives, its members. They're attracted to the cleverness in the way they're handling, you know, the police and authorities that don't know what to make of these folks. But they're also responding to the agenda of the Black Panthers, and certainly in, in no small measure, internationalism. I want to read to you an excerpt--and you heard part of the Executive Mandate Number One being read. This is what they came up to Sacramento to, to announce. I want to read to you a, a longer excerpt.

"At the same time that the American Government is waging a racist war of genocide in Vietnam, the concencra--concentration camps in which Japanese Americans were interned during World War II are being renovated and expanded. Since America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people, we are forced to conclude that these concentration clamps--camps are being prepared for black people who are determined to gain their freedom by any means necessary. The enslavement of black people from the very beginning of this country, the genocide practiced on the American Indians and the confining of the survivors on reservations, the savage lynching of thousands of black men and women, the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and now the cowardly massacre in Vietnam, all testify to the fact that toward people of color the racist power structure of America has one policy: repression, genocide, terror, and the big stick.

Black people have begged, prayed, petitioned, demonstrated, and everything else, to get the racist black power structure of America to right the wrongs which have historically been perpetuated against black people. All of these efforts have been answered by more repression, deceit, and hypocrisy. As the aggression of the racist American government escalates in Vietnam, the police agencies of America escalate the repression of black people throughout the ghettos of America. Vicious police dogs, cattle prods, and increased patrols have become familiar sights in black communities. City Hall turns a deaf ear to the pleas of black people for relief from, from this increasing terror. The Black--The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense believes that the time has come for black people to arm themselves against this terror before it is too late. A people who have suffered so much for so long at the hands of a racist society must draw the line somewhere. We believe that the black communities of America must rise up as one man to halt the progression of a trend that leads inevitably to their total destruction."

Again, an era of heightened prose, certainly, but there's no doubting that the Panthers are tapping into a nerve that¡¯s reverberating throughout America, deepening anxiety of what exactly is going on over in Vietnam, deep concern about what's happening to the young men who come back shell shocked, if not in body bags.

Now so much of the Panthers is about this bravado, so much of the Panthers is about actually doing real work on the ground. And over the course of the, of the, sort of the, the heightened moment of the Panthers' existence, which is really about sixty-six to about seventy-four in terms of its greatest coherence, the Panthers are doing other things as well. Yes, there's no doubt that there are many Panthers who are violating the, the Panther program because they were using alcohol and using drugs. They were also selling drugs and, you know, en--engaged in all kinds of things that are illegal. There's no doubt about that. This is part of the thing that infuriates white America. It's like, "Why are we going to let these thugs have guns for goodness' sakes, and, and tell our police, our right-minded citizens, what to do?"  But the Panthers were also doing things on the ground that people really didn't hear about, or if they heard about it, they ignored.

Looking at a city like Oakland, with essentially a ravaged social services system, the Panthers saw the need for after-school programs for black children and for hot breakfast programs, things that they just weren't getting through the school system. So as the Panthers get a little more organized towards the late sixties and early seventies, you see hot breakfast programs starting, after-school programs starting, you know, basic education, literacy kind of programs starting as well. You also see, not just in Oakland, but in places throughout the country, with a ranges of success, Panther health clinics opening up. These are medical underserved communities. And even though we're the era of the Great Society, when, when LBJ is trying to prop up the poorest people in the country across the board, the quality of healthcare in black communities was abysmal. So the Panthers organized health clinics, free health clinics. You come in--and very successfully organized sickle cell anemia tests, a disease that afflicts African Americans disproportionately in this country, and the Panthers would test for it. And try to find, to help these, these people who get tested positively, to get the medicine they need to live a life without so much discomfort and pain.

So the Panthers were doing social service work, community organizing work, certainly. They were, in their way, trying to enforce law and order, follow the constitution, state constitution as well, and they were also doing those things that terrified so many Americans, in terms of representing this kind of angry, violent, hyper-masculinity and also being involved in, in gun and drug trades. Now Eldridge Cleaver had a particularly important role in cultivating support for the Panther Party and does a lot through Soul on Ice, the book I've asked you to read this week, or read most of this week. Cleaver is, was, a petty criminal, and if you've already started the book, it's, you know, shocking that here's a person who admits to rape and justifying by prac--or not justifying, explained that he practices on black women before his plan to start raping white women. He is, to be as polite as possible, rather homophobic. He goes after James Baldwin in most aggressive ways. But he's also, he¡¯s also quite brilliant, certainly as a cultural commentator, cultural critic. And I want to read a passage from the book that actually helps you understand, or gives you a sense of the ways in which that Cleaver, through Soul on Ice, really fascinated a certain well-heeled part of black America--excuse me, of America, that really helped the Panthers onto the road of success, at least for a time. And I believe this is from about page one hundred and seventy-eight. It's essentially, I think, maybe three sentences I want to read, but it's one heck of a series of three sentences.

"In the swift fierce years since the 1954 school desegregation decision, a rash of seemingly unrelated mass phenomena has appeared on the American scene, deviating radically from the prevailing hotdog and malted milk norm of the bloodless, square, superficial, faceless, Sunday morning atmosphere that was suffocating the nation's soul. And all of this in a nation where the so called molders of public opinion, the writers, politicians, teachers and cab drivers are willful, euphoric liars or zip-dam ostriches and owls, a clique of undercover ghosts, a bunch of Walter Jenkinses, a lot of coffee drinking, cigarette smoking, sly, suck assing, status seeking, cheating, nervous, dry balled, tranquilizer gulched, countdown minded, out of style, slithering snakes. No wonder that many innocent people, the manipulated and the stimulated, some of whom were game for a reasonable amount of mystery and even adventure, had their minds scrambled. These observers were not equipped to either feel or know that a radical break, a revolutionary leap out of their sight, had taken place in the secret parts of this nation's soul. It was as if a drive--it was as if a driverless vehicle were speeding through the American night down an unlighted street toward a stone wall and was boarded on the fly by a stealthy ghost with a drooling leer on his face, who, at the last detour before chaos and disaster, careened the vehicle down a smooth highway that leads to the future and life; and to ask these Americans to understand that they were the passengers on this driverless vehicle and that the lascivious ghost was the Saturday night crotchfunk of the Twist or the "Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!" which the Beatles high-jacked from Ray Charles, to ask these Calvinistic profligates to see the logical and reciprocal links is more cruel than asking a hope to die Okie music buff to cop the sounds of John Coltrane."

It's a heck of four sentences, and really one of the sharpest cultural critiques that I've seen in quite some time. Now, taking back to the very beginning of this course, when I talked about the ironies of John Jack's existence. Remember, the, the charcoal rubbing of the headstone, saying that you couldn't understand, you know, American freedom without understanding slavery. You might remember, I forward¡ªI, I shot forward two hundred years to talk about Eld--excuse me, Ralph Ellison, saying that southern whites could not talk, sing, walk, make love, or make war without thinking of blacks. Eldridge Cleaver is doing the same thing here, in a very different voice, very different voice, mind you. But he's telling about this moment of fascination of white America, progressive, left leaning, white America especially, with blackness. Part of that fascination grows out of the martyrdom of folks like Malcolm X, of course, Medgar Evers, Emmett Till, but it also grows out of this anxiety about what we are as a country during the Vietnam era. It grows out of an anxiety that you see reverberating through radical left groups, largely white groups like the Students for a Democratic Society.

So the Panthers are tapping into a nerve. In fact, a lot of their funding comes from white progressives, who are just completely enthralled by what they see as the brutal honesty of the Panthers. Now building off the Executive Mandate Number One incident in Sacramento, building off of the popularity of Soul on Ice, the Panther Party goes national, starts building its self, its, its social service organizations, its clinics. But this is not to say that things go smoothly. In fact, the Panthers are one car wreck after another, in a sense, as far as its organization's concerned. In October of sixty-seven, Huey Newton is arrested in Oakland, during a dispute over which a cop is shot and dies. He's thrown in jail and you start having "Free Huey" rallies popping up all over the country. The phrase "Free Huey" is in response to this, knowing he's been thrown into jail. The facts about the case were murky at best, and actually in three years, he's released from jail, with the charges dismissed, something that horrifies law and order types.

But while Huey Newton's in jail, the Panthers want to see, they need to feel, they, they, they recognize the need to build upon this trajectory, upward trajectory of popularity, and they reach out to SNCC, Stokely Carmichael in particular. And they offer Carmichael the position of Prime Minister of the Black Panther Party. You know Carmichael's got this magnetism that's got people excited about Black Power. He is being seen by many people across the political spectrum as the heir apparent of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, although of a different kind of politics, but the heir apparent. The Panthers see SNCC as a great resource, because of Carmichael's charisma, certainly, but also because SNCC has proven its chops. It has organized and organized and organized and has a national structure already in place that fans could, you know, build into that structure. SNCC, through Carmichael's thinking, sees that they can tap into this sort of this heady moment in the Panthers, and their international agenda, and build something great.

The problem, however, is that Stokely Carmichael, in a sense, violates the premise of SNCC that had been there for so long, of group centered leadership. He was the head of SNCC, but you just, you know, he didn't actually consult anybody in SNCC about this affiliation. So other SNCC leaders and people on the ground are really, you know, angry. Yeah, they kicked whites out of the movement, so you might think they're really on, in, online, in line with the Panther ideology, but there's no consultation, so they're upset about that. And, as it turns out, because the Panthers were so open about courting white support--through cocktail parties, where Eldridge Cleaver would come up and tell, you know, all the whites in attendance about how bad they are, essentially--because the Panthers courted white support, SNCC militants said, "We have--We've left whites behind. We don't want anything to do with it." 

So the irony is, you know, the way we historicize a group like the Panthers who we hear a lot about, is that, you know, they're the most militant, you know, race nationalist group on the scene. And SNCC, whom less is well known about the group, of course, but it turns out that SNCC, which starts out as this, as this, you know, very polite, respectable group of college kids, white and black, committed to voter registration drives and leadership organization--leadership development, they says, "To hell with all of that. Whites are out. It's about a black agenda."  So the coalition collapses, and in, and in short order, Carmichael is essentially forced out of SNCC because he's now gone far afield of what SNCC has actually--has become. So the Panthers--now we're in early 1968--are trying to make sense of themselves as an organization.

Over the course of the next five or six years, they implode time and again. Huey Newton develops an incredibly damaging drug habit and as the nominal leader of SNCC starts purging people. He kicks out Bobby Seale; that's one of his first targets. Huey Newton, you know, coalesces power around himself. He's purged people left and right. It's almost like, you know, these stereotypes of this, of a demagogue gone a bit crazy. Eldridge Cleaver leaves for exile. Seale is disillusioned; he's left the Panther Party. You have battles developing with other grassroots groups, like the group called US, based out of--essentially based out of UCLA in Los Angeles, under the leadership of Maulana Karenga, a cultural nationalist group that wants to align with the Black Panther Party, but the Panthers are internationally, politically nationalist, not culturally nationalist. And there's a gun battle in Westwood on UCLA's campus between the radicals and US, the group called US, and the Black--members of the Black Panther Party. And then seeding discord this whole time as well are external forces, like especially an FBI program called COINTELPRO, Counterintelligence Program, COINTELPRO.

COINTELPRO started, I think, in the fifties or so, as an anti-counter--anti-radical group, but really gets focused on the Black Panthers more than anybody else, any other organization in the late sixties. The task of COINTELPRO was to infiltrate the Panthers--they were trying to infiltrate everybody, but really focused on the Panthers--infiltrate the Panthers, spread lies, rumors, and discord and watch the Panthers destroy themselves. It turns out they were awfully successful at it. The Panthers, as they uncover one informant after another, or one suspected informant after another, start to implode in places, in, in Detroit, in Chicago, all throughout the country. No one could be trusted. It didn't help that Huey Newton is sort of drug-addled as well. This most amazing moment for the Panthers' existence really is short lived, two or three years, before this really starts to happ--starts to become unspooled. And actually, we can get into the 1970s, women are running the Panthers, and that's when there's the most success with the school lunch programs, these after-school programs--school lunch--hot breakfast programs, excuse me, after-school programs, and health clinics really take off in the early seventies as well.


Chapter 4. ¡®The Panthers¡¯ Lose Popularity [00:38:15]

So these are a number of the events that take us through the late 1960s and into, into the early seventies. By seventy-three, seventy-four, the Panthers are essentially defunct. There's still chapters around throughout¡ªI mean they never--there hasn't been a moment when there have been no--there hasn't been a moment--I'm trying to think this through double and triple negatives here. There have always been Panther chapters, since the Panthers were organized. And you have Panther chapters now called the Gray Panthers. You know, these are folks who are now, you know, sixty and seventy years old, who have not given up on the militant--militant attitudes and progressive critiques, who are trying to organize themselves. But the--it was a flash, a moment in, in time, a brief moment, with the Panthers as sort of this, this group that claimed so much fascination with the American public and fear as well.

Now in talking about the Panthers in this way, sixty-six through the end of the decade, I've left out a whole other narrative that's really quite critical, upon which the Panthers are sort of based its foundation. It's really a narrative of the North. The Panthers are overwhelmingly an urban group, organization and a northern and western organization, based in Oakland, but, you know, you can see them through urban enclaves throughout the northeast, Midwest as well. This is a moment in the late sixties, heading into the early seventies, of, as I said, confusion and dismay. And it's a moment of Martin Luther King taking up the final battles of his life from sixty-six to sixty-eight, as he takes the movement north, the movement--SCLC takes it north, to engage in new battles. Fame--Most famously, he takes the battle to Chicago. And that's what I'll actually spend most of the lecture on, discussion on, on Wednesday. But I want to maybe wrap things up here, it's a couple of minutes early actually, with a reference to a poem that might frame this a little bit. It's a poem by the late poet, Gwendolyn Brooks, one of the great, one of the great American poets. She writes a poem called "We Real Cool."  When asked about the poem--this was written in 1966. This is why I¡¯m reading--I¡¯m bringing this up now, I'm sorry. When writes about the poem--when asked about the poem, Brooks had the following to say:

"I wrote it because I was passing by a pool hall in my neighborhood in Chicago one afternoon and I saw--well, as I said in the poem, seven boys shooting pool. And I'd wondered how they felt about themselves, and I decided that they felt they were not quite valid; that they certainly--that they certainly were insecure. They were not cherished by the society and therefore they would feel that they should, well, spit in the face of the establishment. I used the month of June as a symbol--as a symbol, an establishment symbol, whereas the rest of us love and respect June and wait for it to come so we can enjoy it, they should jazz June, derange it, scratch in it, do anything that would annoy the establishment."

This is Brooks's poem. It's very short.

We real cool. We

Left school. We

Lurk late. We

Strike straight. We

Sing sin. We

Thin gin. We

Jazz June. We

Die soon.

It's a poem that starts out with an assertion of, you know, cool aesthetic that we would see reverberating through the Panthers, certainly, that quickly moves through the despair of living in an inner-city in an African American enclave, caught up in drinking and games. Caught up in an anti-establishment ethos, as she mentioned in describing the poem, but then ultimately caught up in a moment, a language of despair and of hopelessness. "We jazz June. We die soon."  Although King doesn't know that he's going to be assassinated, what you see in the final two years of his life, someone who was truly establishment, Martin Luther King, certainly, you see in the last two years of his life sort of a reckoning with the intransigence of certain problems in the North that create a mindset where you have young men who are hopeless in the possibilities for the future, and of course, like the young men, he too would die soon. And we'll pick up that narrative on Wednesday. Thank you.                          
Lecture 19 - Black Power (continued) [March 31, 2010]
Chapter 1. The Students National Coordinating Committee [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  You'll remember from last lecture, Gwendolyn Brooks'--what I think at least, is a haunting poem--We Real Cool.

We real cool. We
Left school. We
Lurk late. We
Strike straight. We
Sing sin. We
Thin gin. We
Jazz June. We
Die soon.

Written in 1966, but really stands in for, in so many ways, this fundamental shift that I've been talking about the last couple of lectures, and sort of the mentality from mid-1960s, heading into the end of the 1960s. And that's where we are in the course right now. For this lecture will be the last heavily focused on the 1960s. Although it will come up again in next week's lectures, it will only be coming up really in, in fleeting fashion. So really, we're beginning to move out of the 1960s with this lecture.

We've been lingering over the--this period, this decade, for essentially three weeks, two and a half weeks of the course, in no small measure because it is the famous height of the Civil Rights Movement, but because, even though I've been trying to rewrite that narrative for you, the fact is, there are so many different competing lines of activism, of change, of struggle, of frustration, of political brinksmanship of all different sorts, all really captured in this moment. Moments of great promise, followed by moments of great confusion, moments of great promise again, moments of great confusion, and then despair. Overwhelmingly, the story of the late 1960s is one of political and cultural confusion, and one striking moment of--anxiety is far too polite a word to put on it, but real fear, about what, where this country's headed or how it's going to get to where it should be headed.

The barometer, as I pointed out quite some time ago for a lot of these changes in the 1960s, is the Students Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. I want to start there by telling you the end of this, of SNCC's story, essentially. So you'll remember that SNCC was founded out of the, the sit in movement in 1960, college age students, Shaw, North Carolina. It was brought under the wing of the--organized under the wing of the SCLC, embraced an integrationist ethos. Respectability was at its core. Belief in group's inner leadership and is dedicated to civil rights education, where there's voter registration, leadership training, etcetera, in the early 1960s. The cracks start to appear as it struggled to find its own voice, feeling smothered by King's presence. Selma, the famous Bloody Sunday march that SNCC led, and Tuesday turnaround that, that King orchestrated without SNCC's awareness or knowledge marked a fundamental break in the org--between those two organizations.

SNCC then goes on a journey over the next handful of year about what it's going to be and how it's going to run. It's caught up in the Black Power passion of the time. Stokely Carmichael consolidates leadership within his very charismatic self-representation. SNCC kicks whites out of the movement, forms a temporary alliance through Carmichael's doing with the Black Panthers, but SNCC is too radical for the Panthers on race lines. I'll come back and over--overlap a few little details in today's lecture about this, but essentially, Carmichael leaves SNCC. He has no future there. And he leaves the country, in reasons I'll get to later on in the lecture. In the leadership void left behind by Carmichael, you have a cadre of different leaders battling it out, who's going to be the person representing SNCC.

Meanwhile, the organization is infiltrated by the FBI. Seeds of doubt are sown left and right. And the Student Non--Nonviolent Coordinating Committee changes its name to the Student National Coordinating Committee. In the height of late 1960s violence, which is part of the theme of this lecture, it disavows nonviolence as a solution, or as a tactic, or as a belief system. All bets are off. So it goes from nonviolent civil disobedience, integration ethos, to an all black organization, far more progressive than it was when it started and eschewing nonviolence as a core mission. Leadership gets broken up, different kinds of battles. FBI infiltrates it successfully, and by 1973, with leadership in disarray, scattered throughout the, the globe actually, the FBI closes the file on SNCC. There's nothing left of the organization. SNCC is a metaphor for the great successes and great failures and great anxieties of the 1960s.


Chapter 2. Martin Luther King, Jr¡¯s Poverty Campaign in Chicago [00:05:20]

This was a decade of great crescendos and great collapses. Great crescendos, of course, with--embodied in King and his dream, embodied in the signing of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. But as we've seen, immediately after these crescendos, great collapses. Four young, young girls blown up in Birmingham, riots in Watts. So you arrive at the moment, and this is where the lecture really begins--this was all preface--you arrive at the moment of 1966, after Selma, King casting about, I think it's really the fair word to use, casting about for the next step of the movement. Selma was, even though SNCC was infur--was furious with, with King, this successful. The final march was one of the, is, remains, one of the great iconic moments of the, sort of the famous narrative of the Civil Rights Movement. But it became just profoundly clear to King, and to others of course, that these great changes in, in, in law, the great changes in national consciousness, were overwhelmingly seen as southeastern phenomena, southeastern United States phenomena. This is where the problem was.

You saw in whites the--in Watts, excuse me, the problem was something quite different. You see in the great northern cities of the country, the problem was really quite different. They have these laws on the books already. And King goes, decides to go to Chicago in sixty-six to try to address some of these deeply woven, deeply embedded problems that ran along racial lines in the great cities of the north and the northeast. This is where the next stage of the Civil Rights Movement is going to be fought, according to King. King had been talking about, from the beginning of his rise to national prominence, he had been talking about economics and poverty. However, at this moment, sixty-six, partly out of result of searching for the next great agenda for the movement, partly out of the shifting logics of how the U.S. economy is functioning on a global scale, partly out of the radicalism and the internationalist radicalism that starts being articulated more aggressively by SNCC and would soon be articulated by the Black Panther Party, with its Marxist ideology, King really starts to emphasize poverty. This is the next frontier of the movement. This is what we need to address.

So King goes to Chicago, takes the SCLC with him, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with him, and sees in Chicago de facto housing segregation, limited educational opportunities. He sees Chicago as, or the, the way life is lived in Chicago, as a manifestation of economic exploitation, pure and simple, as manifested, grows out of, is part of, the housing problems, educational opportunity differential, manifested in trade unions and the way in which trade unions kept the color line intact. It's manifested in real estate, who could live where. It's manifested in banks, the kind of loans you can get, if you can get loans. Mortgage companies, slum landlords, the welfare system, federal agencies, courts, police, political system, the city administration. It was systemic, economic exploitation, the way it was witnessed, the way it was experienced in Chicago.

So King and SCLC moves from a rather point specific series of campaigns about voter registration drives, for instance, campaigns related to racial discrimination written in the law books, segregation written, you know, de jure into the law books, and recognized, "We've got a much bigger problem here."  The diversity of the agenda that King starts to pursue when he's looking at economic exploitation in all the different places in which it makes itself known in Chicago, it's the diversity of the nature of the problem, ultimately turns into King's undoing in Chicago. Chicago is, giving away the punch line, a, a moment of profound failure for King. So King is in Chicago, setting up shop and by July, the midsummer, things are organized enough and he prepared enough logistically, he organizes a march. He takes several thousand marchers to city hall in Chicago, and much like his namesake quite some time ago, tacks twenty-four demands to the door. Demands called for an end to racial discrimination in the kinds of institutions I mentioned just a moment ago. It was actually not much more than pub--a publicity stunt that King hoped would create space for him at the bargaining table with Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley.

A month later, finally getting an audience with Daley, King presents a ten-point plan on housing. Daley works with the plan. They sign this plan together, and it's calling for open housing reform. So it seems like King's made some difference already. Daley's a staunch Democrat but really embodied--I mean, he owned Chicago politics, heck, he owned state politics. And King got Daley to sign this pledge for housing reform. The signing a pledge isn't really doing anything, except for putting your name on a piece of paper. You've got to put political will behind it. And Daley didn't want to expend any of it when it came to enforcement. So King's earliest efforts in Chicago are merely symbolic efforts. It's not actually creating change. Now Chicago locals were very excited about King's arrival and his pres--and his, and his abiding presence. He's staying in town. Black Chicagoans believe that now that King was there, the city and the country would pay attention to the problems that blacks faced on a daily basis. But the excitement begins to fade just as quickly as it was built up.

[student sneezes] Bless you. Locals begin to realize that King's not really well suited for the complexities of the northern black world. And that sounds kind of condescending. I'm not talking about, you know, does he know how to, you know, buy a loaf of bread and, you know, act properly; that's not it at all. The problem is, is that King is used to, because of the legal structures of discrimination in the South, used to a very simple political landscape. Blacks had no voting presence, they had no representational presence. There were local activists, certainly, but they did not--they were not emboldened in the way--I mean they did not have the kind of support network behind them to catapult things to the national scene. That's not the case in Chicago.

Chicago had significantly more diverse populations within the black community, just in the city itself, than any single place King had been before and tried to wage a campaign. There were many other people who were established leaders in the community, who were recognized as such, and they had their access to Mayor Daley. Then King comes in and wants to have access by himself, not understanding the political theater that defined Chicago. To put simply--I mean to put it in its most simple, simple way, King comes to Chicago and without realizing it, steps, starts stepping on the toes of all these other black leaders who are already in place, who had their organizations, who had their movements, and who had access. Now the real split between Chicagoans and King happens in a swirl of events that surround a march, a march into Cicero, one of Chicago's most famously all-white enclaves.

King organizes a march to call attention like he's done on so many other occasions to systemic discrimination, and the way it's been embodied in Chicago, and then at the last minute, tries to cancel it when, when Daley agrees to sign a, a new housing plan. The actors who had committed themselves to the march were furious and decided to proceed without King. Now right there, there's the difference. In the case of, if you think back to Selma just a year earlier, slightly more than a year earlier, Bloody Sunday following Tuesday turnaround, Chicago--Chicagoans saying, "There will be no turnaround. We've seen you do this before and we're not going to abide by it up in Chicago."  It¡¯s also important--so, so the, the Chicago, the local activists decides, "We're going to march without King. We don't care if he signed anything with the mayor." 

Now what's also important to realize is that the Chicago activists were not trained in a culture of non-vil--nonviolent civil rights activism. Now I think I've already mentioned before, there was a lot of violence in the Civil Rights Movement, violence on all sides. But there was also a commitment, a rhetorical and then a lived commitment, to a nonviolent tradition. One clip actually, I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance to show you, when it came to Freedom Summer, black and white students coming down to Mississippi and having to walk through gauntlets where they were actually beaten by fellow activists to get them ready for what might happen in Mississippi. And if they started to fight back, they couldn't go out in the field. I mean, the training was literally bruising. Chicagoans didn't have that training. So you have an untrained but politically experienced and savvy group, diverse group of activists coming together, to march on Cicero; a lot of anger, a lot of fear as a result.

Knowing all these different facts were in place, the National Guard is brought in immediately. We're not even going to wait for a riot to happen. We're going to start with the National Guard being in place. The National Guard is there to ensure that the march proceeds peacefully. But in a telling sign, the guardsmen's rifles are with, with fixed bayonets, are pointed at the marchers instead of at the hecklers who line the street to protest the march's arrival. So the marchers are walking through a gauntlet of guardsmen, there to protect them, but the marchers are facing the bayonets and the rifles. Well, the march proceeds, but then hecklers, who were there behind the National Guard line, start throwing rocks and bottles and most of the marchers start returning fire. Now it's nothing short of a miracle that the march does not explode into a riot. But it didn't accomplish anything either. Well, I guess it accomplished the fact that King's leadership style was really, at that point, now considered irrelevant in Chicago.

Now I've simplified these--this story about King and Chicago for the sake of time, but this is the core fact, is that King comes to Chicago as the testing ground for his new campaign to bring attention to economic exploitation. It's part of his new agenda relating to poverty or, as, are more clearly articulated agenda relating to poverty. And his organization and his style just don't work. They don't line up with the structured politics in a place like Chicago.


Chapter 3. Martin Luther King, Jr¡¯s Views on Vietnam [00:18:31]

Now complicating things further in all of this, especially for King, is the escalating war in Vietnam. I've made allusions to it a couple of times already, but now we're at a point of crisis for King. He is a pronounced pacifist. He was always against the war, but he had kept his opinions quiet in order to ensure successes in the civil rights agenda, the different battles he was fighting up to that point. King starts to wrestle openly with what he sees as the morality happening over in Southeast Asia, that he's silent on that regard, on that front, that he's talking about the immorality and now the economic system in the United States. He couldn't reconcile the two.

Meanwhile, King's fellow civil rights leaders make a point of talking King out of making a public announcement against the Vietnam War. So King, really seen as the leader of the movement--there's a lot of air quotes there--the leader of the movement, he's really one of equals of the leaders of several other major civil rights organizations, the National Urban League, the NAACP most famously, and they're now trying to silence him, saying, "You cannot risk everything we've been fighting for, for this war someplace else."  One such leader, Whitney Young, of the National Urban League, advised King to, quote, "leave the war to the experts," and that, quote, "the Negro was more concerned about the rat at night and the job in the morning."  Young, Whitney Young, I should point out, was pulled aside--or pulled aside King at Lyndon Johnson's insistence. The White House had been working for--closely with these leaders now for years, working with John F. Kennedy before he was assassinated. He's, you know, trying to convince them to change their agenda in certain ways for the sake of the civil rights bill success, but they're working with John F. Kennedy, they're working with Lyndon Baines Johnson.

And this in itself is a radical shift. I mean, think back to 1941 when A. Philip Randolph bluffs his way, basically, into a meeting with FDR. Now leaders of civil rights organiz--organizations are called into the Oval Office frequently. "How can we manage this crisis?  I need your advice" on this, that, or the other. Well Johnson, who's finding himself now stuck in Vietnam and trying to find a way out, although he's escalating it, Johnson tells the civil rights leaders, hearing rumors about King's increasing confusion--that's not really the word I want to use--confusion about the war, or at least the public agenda. LBJ tells the civil rights leaders, "If you break with me on Vietnam, I will close my door to you."  I mean LBJ's no stranger to brinksmanship. He's an expert at it, and he essentially threatens the civil rights leaders with killing their agenda if they try to get their fingers involved in what he sees as his agenda, that's the war in Vietnam.

As we move through 1966 and into 1967, I mean King got the message. He knows he's not supposed to say anything, but he finds that he can no longer be quiet about this. And he starts giving talks, mostly in the South, about the war in Vietnam. You know, much like the, the famous I Have a Dream speech, where, you know, we only get the, the short excerpt that makes us all feel really wonderful and we don't get the excerpts that make us feel, well, pretty bad, King was giving--I mean so the, the basic speech is much longer than what we know. King is giving, not even sermons, lectures that are forty-five, fifty minutes long, talks, talking about structural inequality, economic super-exploitation, the immorality of the Cold War battles being played out, well, anywhere, but especially in, in the developing world. Giving the kind of lecture you'd expect from a political scientist or an economist and the kind of detail in political economy. He's testing out the ground basically.

And in the spring of 1967, he's invited to speak at Riverside Church in Manhattan, with a long tradition of progressivism, and he famously breaks his silence. I mean he'd been breaking the silence for months now, but now it's on this national platform. And so on April 4th, 1967, King steps to the pulpit at Riverside Church, saying that he felt he could no longer, he could no longer be silent. He declares that the Great Society has been shot down--Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, this effort to, you know, fight a war on poverty--that "the Great Society's been shot down on the battlefields of Vietnam." 

"It would be very inconsistent for me to teach and preach nonviolence in this situation and then applaud violence when thousands and thousands of people are being maimed and mutilated and many killed in this war."

Now King is talking about Vietnamese being killed. He's also talking about American soldiers being killed, and it's a, a theme that you see, you hear more from people on the street who are very angry. I didn't bring it; it's in a different lecture, but the statistics are rather stark about who's going off to fight in Vietnam and who's actually in the positions of most danger and who's dying. The poor, regardless of the race, and African Americans in numbers far disproportionate to their representation in the U.S. public, the poor and blacks are the ones that are in the most dangerous positions and essentially become cannon fodder in the Killing Fields. So, you know, King is not on his own amongst black leaders for being horrified--in black citizens, being horrified what's happening in Vietnam. He decides to break his silence.

[Martin Luther King:]  Now, I've chosen to preach about the war in Vietnam today because I agree with Dante, that the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in a period of moral crisis maintain their neutrality. There comes a time when silence is betrayal. The truth of these words is beyond doubt, but the mission to which they call us is a most difficult one. Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government's policy, especially in time of war. Nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought within one's own bosom and in the surrounding world. Moreover, when the issues at hand seem as perplexing, as they often do in the case of this dreadful conflict, we are always on the verge of being mesmerized by uncertainty. But we must move on. Some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony. But we must speak. We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak."

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  And as I've already alluded to, or mentioned a few moments ago, King continues to speak about the linkages between--in the speech--about the linkages between capitalist economies, their imperialist tendencies in the war in Southeast Asia. This was not a King that the national public knew; didn't recognize this person. This was also not a King that LBJ was going to tolerate. He immediately distances, distances himself from King. Just as he threatened to do, he followed through. The White House is now closed to King and SCLC. Now just as this is not a King that people recognized for his sort of laser-like focus on political, economy, hyper-capitalism; it's a King that's not been mor--memorialized for all of us. It brings us back to something that I've been talking about, the issues of how we remember, how we've been taught to remember the Civil Rights Movement and what those national narratives do as far as how we interpret our own notion of what makes a citizen.

It's a period of incredible anxiety. Urban violence is spreading unchecked. In Detroit, thirty-five people die in a huge race riot. In Newark, nearly as many as--are left dead. I mean, Newark's seen as an incredible battle zone. The statistics of the amount of bullets that were fired by the police state is rather astonishing, the order of thousands upon thousands, compared to the number of shots fired by those people who were rioting. And as you know, Newark is still struggling with the legacy of these, of these, of what happened in the 1960s, the late sixties. It's a city still on its mend. In early 1968, a little less than a year after he comes out against the Vietnam War, King issues a call for a massive protest event, called the Poor People's Campaign. It's an event that would take place in Washington, D.C., and would call national, and hopefully international, attention to the plight of the poor, regardless of color.

At the same time that King's developing this, the logistics for this campaign, he agrees to lend his support to a strike by sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee. Sanitation workers were clamoring for union recognition, and the city's black community--this was largely a black force--and the city's black community lent its hearty support. The mayor refused to acknowledge the black workers. An economic boycott followed that almost crippled the city, and a riot was barely averted, despite the fact that citizens essentially began to attack the police on one occasion. It's a heightened era of urban violence and systemic economic exploitation. King comes to Memphis in March and tries to rally the public. He has to leave town very quickly, but he returns. He said he was going to return in ten days, and he vowed that he would stay put, which is not something that King did. But he would stay put in Memphis until the workers were recognized. On April third, King speaks to an audience at a nighttime rally.

Now it's important to understand, by this point in his young life, and he really was a young man, King was frustrated and dismayed. The civil rights establishment figures with whom he had grown up politically, that he had led essentially, the establishment figures had now distanced themselves from him. The White House had cut him off, and this was always his trump card. Remember back when, when John F. Kennedy's running for the White House, they used each other to, sort of, pull attention to troubled situations in the South and Birmingham most famously. But the White House is now closed to him, and since the successes of sixty-three, sixty-four, and sixty-five, King had only been met with a series of setbacks. Now he's struggling mightily to pull off a new direction in his public activism via the Poor People's Campaign. It's a bringing together of his racial world views and his economic, his class world views.

For months leading up to this April third speech, King had been walking round in sort of a daze. I mean if you've seen¡ªI, I, I've been trying for years to find this movie again. King gives a speech at Stanford University, I want to say sixty-seven. I'm not quite sure of the year, but it's between sixty-seven, maybe early sixty-eight, and the King--it's a film, it¡¯s a, you know, full--they filmed the speech from beginning to end. And it is a King that we, that we are not used to seeing. I mean, he is flat out exhausted and depressed, and you only get to his--some moments, you know, four-fifths of the way through this hour long speech or so, where you get these recognizable moments of oratorical flight. But the rest of it, he's, you know, he¡¯s just despairing about the human condition. People worried about him working himself to a state of exhaustion, wondering about his spirit. They were disturbed by the fact that he¡¯d been, he'd been having visions of his own death, literally thinking that his time on earth was actually limited. He's giving the speech on April third, trying to rally the Memphis sanitation workers in the community. And then towards the end of his speech, he turns his attention to his own mortality and his notions of how long he might be on this planet.

Martin Luther King:  And some began to say that threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers? Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. So I'm happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord."

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  That would be the last speech that King would give. The next afternoon, April 4th, 1968, a year to the date after he comes out against the Vietnam War at Riverside Church, he's assassinated.


Chapter 4. The Riots after Martin Luther King, Jr¡¯s 1968 Assassination [00:35:30]

As news of King's death races across the country, cities go up in flames. Uprisings occur in over one hundred cities, over fifty people are killed collectively, thousands are injured. Seventy thousand troops are called out around the country to restore order. Large sections of cities like Chicago and Washington, D.C., are wiped out. Chicago's mayor, so recently an ally of King, terrified of what's going to happen in the wake of his assassination--not terrified, angry--gives his police the order to shoot to kill. I know from personal experience, having done a lot of research from my dissertation and first book, Washington, D.C., at Howard University, these riots happened in 1968. Areas around Howard were still burned out in the early 1990s, I mean, still. If you've been donw, down to Washington DC in the last six or seven years, the city that you see in those areas around U Street, east of Dupont Circle, north of the capital, those areas are unrecognizable. The change or the restoration of those parts of the city took well over thirty years.

Now King's death is one of the most important moments in a year of real horror. Nineteen sixty-eight, students on many university campuses radicalize, joining new protest movements, taking over campus buildings. If you look at the buildings of the early 1970s, you can tell what's basically riot architecture: you know, large stone buildings with very small windows that chairs cannot be thrown through. Radical black workers organize into the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement, the critique of its economic exploitation. LBJ announces that he will not run for re-election. Robert F. Kennedy is assassinated the night he wins the California Democratic primary. Democratic national convention is held in Chicago. It's a convention marred by police rioting. You know, they battered demonstrators and reporters on a daily basis. COINTELPRO, the counterintelligence program, is trained upon black radicals, starts beating up on the Black Panthers, one of the groups J. Edgar Hoover called "hate group."  Starts infiltrating S--excuse me, SNCC--and begins to break that organization up.

Around the world, the French government collapses when nine million workers stage a general strike against Charles de Gaulle, only to have the country's armed forces mobilized to restore order. In Mexico, the government ordered its troops to fire upon hundreds of student protesters who were trying to call attention to their plight in the weeks preceding the start of the Mexico City Olympics. Famously, Tommy Smith and John Carlos, sprinters for the U.S. Olympic team, did the famous Black Power salute when they were on the medal stand; stripped of their medals. Richard Nixon narrowly defeats Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey for President, and Nixon wins by brokering a deal with Strom Thurmond, a powerful senator from South Carolina, promising Thurmond that he would lay off the South in regards to civil rights if Thurmond would deliver southern votes to Nixon instead of to the third party candidate, George Wallace, who happens to get nearly ten million votes, by the way.

In the midst of all this confusion, King's assassination, Stokely Carmichael, who I already mentioned as seen as being the heir apparent to the civil rights leadership pantheon, you know, the next great black leader. He's isolated, he¡¯s--I mean essentially not in the Panthers, he's isolated from SNCC, but people are still thinking that he might be the one to take up King's mantle. But in the wake of King's assassination, and D.C. going up in flames especially, people start blaming Carmichael for the riot, for fanning the hysteria about the riot, that turns into the riot, and start blaming him for not being able to restore order. And Carmichael actually flees the country and essentially lives in exile the rest of his life. The, the, quote, job, and I really put big quotes around it, the job of leading black America is unstaffed and maybe unmanageable. In the wake of King's assassination, as the riots are cooling down, leaders start to--the other leaders of the civil rights organizations, people in King's inner-circle are saying, "What are we going to do to honor King?  What can we do?  The count--the count--the world is in disarray." 

Chapter 5. The Poor People¡¯s Campaign [00:41:10]

Well, there was the Poor People's Campaign, and they decide, you know, "To honor King's legacy, we're going to carry forth with that campaign."  They see it as a real opportunity to marry race politics with class politics, so they start organizing a plan to bring poor people from ten cities and five rural districts to Washington, D.C., and stay for three months, calling attention to their daily plight and calling for a thirty billion dollar anti-poverty package, that included a commitment to full citizen--full employment, a guaranteed annual income, and increased construction of low-income housing. In mid-May, the first wave of demonstrators arrive in D.C., and one week later, Resurrection City, it's a, a tent city, is built on the Washington Mall, a settlement of tents and shacks to house the protesters. But the campaign is hobbled by events that are beyond its control. It's hoping for fifteen hundred protesters to come to D.C., but seven thousand come instead.

During the midst of the campaign, Robert Kennedy is assassinated. It completely distracts the government from the activists in its midst, and then the skies open up and turns Resurrection City into one big mudflat, and very quickly the escalating public health problems. There's not enough housing and tents. There's not enough essentially porta-potties, there's not enough ways to feed these people. And the government, acting on concern for the activists' health--it becomes an epidemiological nightmare--closed the camp after one month. So the Poor People's Campaign, "We're going to be here for three months to raise--call attention to the plight of poor folks," becomes very successful in terms of the number of people. It overwhelms logistics, and then Mother Nature intervenes, and for the health of the people, the government closes the camp after one month. This in the midst of all these catastrophes had--happening on the international stage.

So we have at the end of 1968 a new era of national politics that beginning, that, that marks the beginning of a backlash against civil rights gains and the articulation of policies that had no explicit racial reference, who are clearly coded racially all the same. Nixon, as he's campaigning and brokering dealing--brokering a deal with Strom Thurmond, campaigns on a law and order platform. Such a platform made plain that he would go after black radicals and, admittedly, the de--the degenerate hippies and anti-war activists who were destroying the country, in Nixon's view. Law and order; "we're going to get this house back in shape."  This is the state of affairs that leads us out of the 1960s and into the 1970s. The country's damaged, profoundly. Its confidence is shaken, and it's about to get worse, actually. I want to play for you two clips that underscore the tenor of the time.

This is an era, you know, of, you know, of great political turmoil, but also an era of incredible cultural production, I mean, astonishing. The Beatles go from "Yeah, yeah, yeah!" no matter who they might have ripped it off from, according to Eldridge Cleaver, you know, to the incredible studio albums of the late sixties, rock n' roll, Motown, all of these things mature in a way. This is on the stage of the most important sort of cultural consumptive moments that people had seen. But closer to the ground, you have a marriage of black activism and anger and cultural production that tells a story of despair. These are two clips by spoken word artist Gil Scott-Heron. I'll let them run into the other, one into the other. The first one is an excerpt from his performance piece called The Revolution Will Not Be Televised. The next one, a culture critique of economic exploitation and the, the space race, while ignoring folks on the ground, it's called Whitey on the Moon.

[Gil Scott-Heron:] The revolution will not be right back after a message
about a white tornado, white lightning, or white people. 

You will not have to worry about a dove in your
bedroom, a tiger in your tank, or the giant in your toilet bowl.
The revolution will not go better with Coke.
The revolution will not fight the germs that may cause bad breath.
The revolution will put you in the driver's seat.

The revolution will not be televised, will not be televised,
will not be televised, will not be televised.
The revolution will be no re-run brothers;
The revolution will be live.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  A lot of his lyrics talking about the--sorry, I can't resist saying something--corporate capitalism, you know, talk about all these ad campaigns, the tiger in your tank referring to Exxon and talking about, what?, Scope and bad breath. I mean this is--He's fighting against what he would consider the square corporate culture of Madison Avenue and what they're trying to sell to the American people.

Gil Scott-Heron:  A rat done bit my sister Nell.
(with Whitey on the moon)
Her face and arms began to swell.
(and Whitey's on the moon)
I can't pay no doctor bills.
(but Whitey's on the moon)
Ten years from now I'll be payin' still
While Whitey's on the moon.
You know, the man jus' upped my rent las' night,
'cause Whitey's on the moon.
No hot water, no toilets, no lights,
but Whitey's on the moon.
I wonder why he's uppi' me?
'cause Whitey's on the moon?
Well I wuz already givin' 'im fifty a week
And now Whitey's on the moon.
Taxes takin' my whole damn check,
The junkies make me a nervous wreck,
The price of food is goin' up,
An' as if all that crap wuzn't enough,
A rat done bit my sister Nell.
(with Whitey on the moon)
Her face an' arms began to swell
And Whitey's on the moon.
Was all that money I made las' year
For Whitey on the moon?
How come I ain't got no money here?
Hmm! Whitey's on the moon.
Y'know I jus' about had my fill
Of Whitey on the moon.
I think I'll sen' these doctor bills,
Airmail special...                            To Whitey on the moon.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  They picked an interesting moment to walk in, didn't they?  [students laugh]  Anyway, we're going to pick up at that moment of cultural challenge, and anger, and power when we reconvene on Monday morning. Have a great weekend.
Lecture 20 - The Politics of Gender and Culture [April 5, 2010]
Chapter 1. Events Surrounding the Invasion of Cambodia [00:00:00]

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Now you remember from last week that we're in the moment of phasing out of the 1960s, moving into the 1970s, but of course, human actions, inactions, chronology, is not simply as neat as dates on a, on a calendar as a timeline. A lot of the social confusion, violence, and cultural excitement actually, of this era, of the late sixties, is right there in the 1970s. And this lecture's actually trying to canvass some of the political turmoil and its, its marriage to popular culture in the early 1970s. By way of context though, let me start in the spring of 1970. On April 30th--and actually, let me focus--it¡¯s, frankly, just focus on two weeks in 1970. On April 30th, President Nixon announces the invasion of Cambodia, escalation of the war in Southeast Asia in general, and the need for one hundred and fifty thousand more troops to find a lasting peace. In response, the campus at Kent State in Ohio, the ROTC building is set on fire. The Ohio governor dispatches National Guard to make sure that the campus remains peaceful. Onto May 4th, this attempt to keep the peace on Kent State evaporates, when twenty-eight Guardsmen open fire on Kent State students, killing four and wounding nine.

Immediately--immediately being a day--five hundred colleges are shut down across the country, or they're disrupted from protests. Our country, according to college protestors, our country is now attacking us. It makes tremendous headlines. On May 14th, ten days--[student sneezes] bless you--ten days after Kent State, at Jackson State University, a historically black university, during a student protest, state and highway patrolmen open fire with automatic weapons into dormitories. Allegations are that someone was sniping at them. No evidence was ever found to that, to that end. They opened fire without any warning, killed two students and wounded nine. The scale of national attention is not commensurate with what happens at Kent State. So for, in the African American community, there is a sense that the police state, in this case, state and highway patrolmen, could kill our college students without anybody worrying too much, but at Kent State, also inexcusable, that if you kill the students, it becomes a national catastrophe.

Meanwhile, in New Haven, just about two blocks from here--well, actually, all throughout New Haven--the Black Panther Party and the FBI are at a standoff. Black Panther Party and fellow travelers had come to New Haven, essentially to protest the murder trial of Bobby Seale, who's accused of authorizing the murder of Alex Rackley, member of the Black Panther Party, people believed to have been an informant to the FBI. Fifteen thousand people descend upon the green, Panthers, Panther supporters, sort of anarchist hippies, called the Yippies, by--led by Abbie Hoffman, fellow travel--travelers of all sorts. And there was a real fear that the city is going to be collapsed into a race riot. The university, under the leadership of Kingman Brewster, the president at the time, does something that people never expected, and actually opened its doors to the Black Panthers. It created a mechanism, it felt--Brewster felt, that would relieve some of the pent up anxiety and tension over what's happening around the country and then locally.

Classes are canceled; there's student strikes. I think two or three pipe bombs go off at Ingalls Rink. It's a level of chaos that you, that you are not familiar with. Kingman Brewster declares that he actually doubts--and I'm paraphrasing here--whether a black person can get a fair trial anywhere in America. Immediately, the alums start phoning in, calling for his resignation, for his outlandish statement. It's a national event, student unrest; it's a local story as well.


Chapter 2. Marvin Gaye Album: ¡°What¡¯s going on?¡± [00:05:24]

In this spirit of what's going on in the country on the college campuses, and the nation, the call for federal troops--excuse me, for more military troops, the invasion of Cambodia, you have an astonishing, almost sort of a call and response by a lot of cultural artists. Most famous in this regard--well, most famous to me at least, in this regard--is Marvin Gaye. Marvin Gaye, who had made a career at Motown by piecing together and performing love songs, branches out a year later in May of 1971 with something really quite different. So he's known for, for this:

<<Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell, Ain't No Mountain High Enough excerpt plays>>

Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Don¡¯t worry baby

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  I mean, really catchy love songs, really quite--you know, they're actually important in the history of the evolution of rock music and the Motown sound. But by--when we get into 1970, Gaye is wrestling with, well, partly exhaustion from churning out these saccharine laden songs, but also he's wrestling with what's going on in the country, and he wants to aspire to do something quite different. And he earns, secures himself a new contract with Motown and he's given creative license, which is astonishing. This is the big sort of rupture in Motown. He's given creative license, and he turns--and he generates a concept album. The album's called What's Going On?  It's dealing with Vietnam, it's dealing with economic despair, with incredible inflation going on in the country. It's dealing with ecological despair, and this is a few years before Earth Day would actually take effect, when people are wondering what we're doing to this particular planet. In fact, I've often, when I've given this lecture--as of one time, I hadn't given a, a cultural politics lecture for years, and I finally realized it was time to do so. And I listened to What's Going On? Just to see if I wanted to play a clip, and I realized, I could actually just put the CD on, leave the room, have you guys understand the nineteen, early 1970s by the time the album was over. But, well, I have to get up and say something.

So you have a moment of escalating war in Vietnam, fear of, of destruction of the planet, ecologically speaking, environmentally speaking, hyperinflation in the United States, poverty, urban decay. And Marvin Gaye starts writing these pieces, or produces these songs. They merge one into another in What's Going On? and, in fact, if you do want to learn about the 1970s, just go out and--I used to say buy the album at the record store, then you could buy the CD, and now it's just, you know, go to iTunes, I suppose. Although you should patronize Cutler's, the local record store. [Students laugh]  One of his signature songs from the album, "What's Happening, Brother?"  It's the story of a returning vet, comes back from Vietnam, trying to figure out what is happening on the street, really trying to get back into the mundane routine of life. I'll play a clip of it.

<<music>>

[Marvin Gaye]: Hey baby, what you know good
I'm just getting back, but you knew I would
War is hell, when will it end,
When will people start getting  together again
Are things really getting better, like the newspaper said
What else is new my friend, besides what I read
Can't find no work, can't find no job my friend
Money is tighter than it's ever been
Say man, I just don't understand
What's going on across this land
Ah what's happening brother,
Oh yeah, what's happening, what¡¯s happening my man?

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  If you have the lyrics sheet in front of you, it's self evident. For those of you who don't, the guy's just come back from war. He's wondering, if he's reading the newspaper, if what he's reading is true, and he's talking about civil rights here, of things actually getting better. Can't find a job though, money is tight. "I don't understand what's going on around here."  And then just wondering, you know, are they still doing stuff they used to do, going to the dances?  Do you think anybody has a chance to succeed, in this case, a ball club?  "I want to know what's going on, what's happening."  Someone who's lost and trying to find his way. Very soon, you get an answer in the same album, in the song "Inner City Blues."  Harkening back to Gil Scott-Heron, "Whitey on the Moon."

[Marvin Gaye]:  Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots.
Money, we make it;
'Fore we see it you take it.
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life.
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life.
This ain't living, This ain't living
No, no baby, this ain't living
No, no, no.
Inflation, no chance
To increase finance.
Bills pile up sky high.
Send that boy off to die.
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Sending people to the moon?  Spend it on people who don't have anything, please, instead. People taking all of our money. This is exactly Gil Scott-Heron's lament from the same era. He closes the song, throwing up both my hands in a lament. Now if you think I'm stretching this just a little bit, I mean, this is just one album, after all, let me share with you a personal story. It's happening in 1971, seventy-two, and seventy-three. I was too young to remember it, actually, but in 1990--let me think, when would this have been--1997 or so, I was living in Los Angeles. My father and mother had come to visit me and my wife, and we're driving. We go out to--he'd lived in L.A. for a while when--during this era--we drive out to visit some old friends of his in Los Angeles, have a great night. Come back, we¡¯re driving back and I happen just to put on this album. I listen to it all the time. He and my mother riding in the back seat and after a while, I realize what--something doesn't sound quite right. And then I realize, what I'm hearing in the back seat is weeping, I mean, flat out weeping. I turn down the music, ask what's going on, and my father just says, "I can't--you know, I just can't talk, can¡¯t talk about it."  Get back to the house. I've never seen this guy cry in my entire life. I don't know what, what is actually happened.

I sit down with him and my mother says, "Wendell, just tell him what's going--what happened there."  And my father essentially had a flashback. He was a Vietnam vet himself, fought--flew in the Air Force. And he's saying that album just brought everything back. I mean, "You just don't, you just don¡¯t understand," he tells me, "what it was like."  People going off and trying to--risking their lives for their country, and being treated the way they were treated upon their return. And Marvin Gaye really understood the sense of confusion that many people, not just the vets, but certainly in his case, the vets come back trying to figure out what is going on in this country, what do they actually fight for?  Feeling a sense of moral confusion as well. My father even talked about the, you know, the economy and the ecological landscape, all in that same moment. He goes, "That album really captured it all. Marvin Gaye understood what was going on." 

Now this album, What's Going On?, fluctuates between the international critique and also things happening in U.S. cities, again, this economic despair, I keep coming back to it. It's really one of the defining elements of the time.


Chapter 3. Shaft: The Celebration of Black Masculinity, Virility, and Culture [00:15:36]

You also have, during this moment, this rise of, in, in line with the Black Panther Party, certainly, this rise of a celebration of black masculinity, black virility, and also black cultural celebration. Quite a different one than the Harlem Renaissance, certainly, but a black cultural celebration all the same. Take these elements together, sort of this culturally rich moment, the notion of abiding economic troubles, and also determination that we, in this case the black man--and I use that phrase quite intentionally--are going to turn the system over. We're going to be something different. You end up with an incredibly popular movie and character. The character's name is John Shaft, and the movie is Shaft. I'll play for you some lyrics, show you a clip, and then explain a bit of what is actually happening in this piece.

<<music>>

[Isaac Hayes]: Who's the black private dick
That's a sex machine to all the chicks?
Shaft!
You're damn right!
Who is the man that would risk his neck
For his brother man?
Shaft!

Can you dig it?
Who's the cat that won't cop out
When there's danger all about?
Shaft!
Right On!
They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother.
Shut your mouth!
But I'm talking about Shaft.
Then we can dig it!
He's a complicated man
But no one understands him but his woman
John Shaft!

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Every year I play this, I forget to do a vocal boost, because the lyrics--Isaac Hayes's voice is so deep, that you lose out on the lyrics.

"Who's the private--who's the black private dick
That's a sex machine to all the chicks?    

(You're supposed to say "Shaft!") <<Students laugh>>
You're damn right!
Who is the man that would risk his neck
For his brother man?"

Student: "Shaft!"

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Thank you. [Students laugh]

"Can you dig it?
Who's the cat that won't cop out
When there's danger all about?"

Students:  "Shaft!"

Professor Jonathan Holloway: "Right On!
You see, this cat is--this Shaft is a bad mother."

Student: "Shut your mouth!"

Professor Jonathan Holloway: "But I'm talking about Shaft." All right, you get it. Anyway, I mean it is, it is humorous, especially when looking like this, and being what I am, and singing this song. [Students laugh]  But, but the song was incredibly important. Isaac Hayes breaks out as well, out of the Motown sort of trap, and comes out with this album that electrifies people. He's talking about a kind of individual they had not seen before, they had not been around before. And then the movie comes out. I mean this was the soundtrack to the movie.

<<Shaft movie, soundtrack plays>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway: So you're walking through New York, Time Square, which used to be a complete cesspool.

<<Shaft movie, soundtrack plays>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  I'll fix it.

<<Shaft movie, soundtrack plays>>

[Shaft]: Come on, get out of the way.

[Man 1]: Want a time piece, brother?

Professor Jonathan Holloway: Now I played the extended clip here. There's a couple of moments that are rather important. One is just the street scene that Shaft is walking through. New York City, Time Square, is not the place you've come to know with its, with its sort of carnival atmosphere. It was a place of, you know, triple X movie theaters, prostitutes, drug use and such. And John Shaft comes up, emerges in this landscape, and walks through it, a man on a mission. Thirty-four seconds into this clip, into the start of the movie, you may have seen it or not. I don't know if the lights were down enough yet for you, but he crosses the street and someone comes up about to hit him. He stops the car and gives them the finger. You know, in the grand scheme of things, especially with what we see today in our movies, in our YouTube clips, this is, this doesn't even register. This was a mind blowing moment in American cinema, when this movie comes out. A black man, walking through a place like he owns it, giving the finger to a white guy in a car, and he continues walking. He's walking through, his long, leather black coat. Certainly reminiscent of the Panthers, but he looks a little bit different. And it turns out, when this guy tries to sell him a hot timepiece, that he's a cop. So the question is, who's the man?

Students:  Shaft!

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Yeah, thank you!  [Students laugh]  Well played, yes. That Shaft is the man. He's virile, he's masculine. As the lyrics say, "he's a complicated man."  And so you have a new kind of visual representation of blackness. [Student sneezes] Bless you.


Chapter 4. Blaxploitation Film: ¡°Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song¡± [00:22:48]

Now Shaft is one of the, the finer productions of a, of a cultural moment in cinema called Black--Blaxploitation. Pardon me, I have to multitask a little bit here. Blaxploitation begins in 1971, begins, you know, all in this moment. It begins with the movie, really an art piece by a man named Melvin, Melvin Van Peebles. The movie's called Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song. The movie is--I find it very difficult to watch, just from the kind of messages it's giving, and also because of its cinematic qualities, and because it's in some way--well, I don't care for the movie. But anyway, it's incredibly important.

It starts with the unnamed narrator, or protagonist, I suppose, seen being raised by prostitutes, he becomes a hustler. He give witness to a moment of po--police brutality. He kills a bad cop and because he committed one of the ultimate offenses, he has to go on the run. And the movie is essentially him--it's a flight movie. He's going through all these different scenes, trying to keep one step in front of the man. And the man, as it turns out in this case, is powerfully corrupt. There's a lot of power; but that power has corrupted him. And you see Melvin Van Peebles, he's the lead in his own movie, you know, going through I mean any kind of slice of life you can imagine, representing the 1970s: drug use, sex scenes, pimping, prostitution, crime, always trying to stay one step in front of the man.

And the movie becomes an inspiration for the formula that becomes Blaxploitation. It's a movie that dismisses assimilation, that declares the system's corrupt. It is a reflection of Black Power militancy, no matter what it's a counter to white hegemony. This is how you could characterize most of the Blaxploitation films. There are wrinkles; we'll get to that in a moment. But I want to play for you one of the last few clips of the movie. What you're seeing here, it's a, it¡¯s a strange close up, the camera looking down in a shallow creek, panning up to see a, to see a, a gutted, a gutted police dog that had come to hunt down the narrator. You see it from a slightly comfortable distance. And again, it's a, it¡¯s a movie that's about flight.

<<Excerpt from Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song plays>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  It's actually hard to watch because of the dissonance and the rough film quality. Well, the movie's shot on a five hundred thousand dollar budget, shot in the course of two weeks, has an all black crew. So it's giving a message about sort of a non-assimilationist black pride and it's actually doing it as well. And the movie--oh and I think it aspires for an X rating, which had a different connotation early seventies than it does now, because that way they could get outside of the union system, and then have an all black crew. Shot for five hundred grand, grosses two million--ten million dollars, excuse me, ten million dollars, a tremendous return on investment. And this is what really launches this five year period of the genre. They are often low budget, Shaft being really a different creature in this regard, it¡¯s a high budget film. Most of them are low budget. They make a ton of money. The production values aren't that wonderful. They're mostly action films. They're very simplistic in its construction: black is good, white is black--bad. They are hyper-masculine, and they're misogynist.

So when people think about Blaxploitation, is it about black identity, about a certain kind of blackness?  Is it about cultural production?  Or was it a co-opted capitalist venture?


Chapter 5. Blaxploitation Film: ¡°Super Fly¡± [00:28:16]

After Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song, most of the Blaxploitation film--films become studio productions. No matter what you decide Blaxploitation is, it's important to think about the images that it presents. They all weren't about revolutionaries or tough upstanding men. They're about different kinds of people. I'll play a clip from the movie Super Fly as a way to access this particular part of the narrative.

<<music>>

[Curtis Mayfield:] 

I'm your mama, I'm your daddy,
I'm that nigga in the alley.
I'm your doctor when you need
want some coke, have some weed.
You know me, I'm your friend
Your main boy, thick and thin
I'm your pusherman, I'm your pusherman
Ain't I clean, bad machine
super cool, super mean
Feeling good for the man
Super fly here I stand.
Secret stash, heavy bread,
baddest bitches in the bed
I'm your pusherman. I'm your pusherman.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  So this is a song celebrating the pusher.

"I'm your mama, I'm your daddy, I'm that nigga in the alley.
I'm your doctor when you need
want some coke, have some weed.
You know me, I'm your friend
Your main boy, thick and thin."

So who is the pusherman? I'll play the opening montage from Super Fly.

<<Excerpt from Super Fly plays>> 

Professor Jonathan Holloway: The main character is getting out of his car. That is the main, lead character.

<<Excerpt from Super Fly plays>> 

[Man 1]: [Inaudible]

[Man 2]: Yeah

[Man 1]:  [Inaudible] Motherfucker. We going for life, we got that shit.

Professor Jonathan Holloway: The filmmakers didn't need a set; they had New York City. Used as a perfect backdrop.

<<Excerpt from Super Fly plays>> 

<<Baby cries>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  So I played this extended clip the same way I played Shaft. I mean these movies are coming out at essentially the same time, but they're telling quite a different story. Walking through different parts of New York City, certainly. Shaft walking with power and authority, since he is the man, and the pusherman doing something really entirely quite different. Still, also walking through New York City and its economic--sights of economic devastation. Right before this clip, you see the pusherman getting out of bed. He has, as the lyrics in the Curtis Mayfield song, "the baddest bitches in the bed," getting out of bed with a white woman, which is of course important for all the racial narratives about that kind of coupling possibility, living in a very fancy apartment, and he's really trying to get out. He¡¯s made enough money, trying to get out of the system. Then he's got to get these petty thieves who are trying to take some of his, his dope.

The story is then about a pusherman trying to exit the high life. He's going to make one final score and retire. But he, as the story goes through, he discovers that the people who are actually the drug pins, kingpins in New York City, the ones he has to make this final score with, are the police. The commissioner of the police is the biggest kingpin, drug kingpin in the city, and the pusherman comes to the heroic conclusion, by framing, or setting up, the police commissioner. So you have here perhaps a hero, perhaps an antihero. It's really quite unclear, but you certainly--I mean in terms of what's being celebrated here--but you certainly have the lingering part of Blaxploitation, that the man, when it is the white man--not John Shaft of course--the man, usually a person of great authority, structurally in the system, is the cause of degradation in the black community.


Chapter 6. Blaxploitation Film: "Foxy Brown" [00:35:43]

Now, I've talked about the fact that Blaxploitation is celebrating manhood of a complicated nature. It's also doing something quite different. You know, people often point to Pam Grier as a wonderful example of a Blaxploitation film star. You know, she's always winning in the end. One of her first movies in this regard, Foxy Brown, is a story about Foxy. Her brother is set up by drug kingpins. This is one of the great narratives of Blaxploitation. Her boyfriend is killed by the man, and she's going to infiltrate the mob to exact her revenge. And the way she infiltrates it is becoming a prostitute. In fact, at the beginning of the movie, before this stuff un, un, unwinds, you have Pam Grier getting out of bed with the phone ring, phone rings. And within a few seconds, she's bare chested. I mean this is what Blaxploitation and white--and, and female power is suggested by Pam Grier, her sexuality is her power. Anyway, I want to play the last couple of minutes from Foxy Brown. It has a twist on this narrative of who's the man, in fact, how Black Power is interwoven in this, in interesting ways.

<<Excerpt from Foxy Brown plays>> 

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  What you¡¯re seeing here is the drug kingpin¡¯s boyfriend being stopped. Black mobsters have taken over. Posing as the police, and now they¡¯ve caught him.

<<Excerpt from Foxy Brown plays>> 

[Kingpin]: What are you going to do?  What do you want?  What are you guys going to do?  What are you crazy? What do you--

[Black Mobster]: He¡¯s ready, sister.

[Kingpin]: No, you--You're crazy. You can¡¯t do this!  You can¡¯t do that!  No!  No, Foxy!  Oh no, you can¡¯t. <<screams>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  And this is the drug kingpin, as it turns out, the person behind Foxy Brown's boyfriend's murder, her brother, her brother being set up as well. The alarm¡¯s been tripped.

<<Excerpt from Foxy Brown plays>> 

[Man 1]: Hold it right there, spook.

[Man 2]: You¡¯re going to be a spook for real pretty soon. Hands up.

[Foxy]: Don¡¯t pinch the fruit, faggot.

[Man 2]: You watch your mouth or I¡¯ll--

[Woman 1]: No Eddie, later. I want to know what she¡¯s doing here.

[Man 2]: I¡¯ll take that thing now.

[Foxy]: Sure, I brought it for you, Ms. Pimp. Like I said, it¡¯s a present from your faggot boyfriend.

[Woman 1]: See what it is, Eddie. [Man 2 opens the bag]  What is it?

[Man 2]: I don¡¯t know, it looks like a pickle jar or something

[Woman 1]: Bring it here. [Package explodes. Foxy pulls her gun out and shoots Man 1 and Man 2. Woman 1 grabs a knife. Foxy shoots at her.]  Why don¡¯t you kill me too?  Go on, shoot, I don¡¯t want to live anymore.

[Foxy]:  I know. That¡¯s the idea. The rest of your boyfriends are still around. And I hope you do them a long time. And then maybe you get to feel what I feel. Death is too easy for you, bitch. I want you to suffer.

[Woman 1]: screams

[Voiceover]: Super bad.

[Foxy]: The party¡¯s over, Oscar, let¡¯s go.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  So you have in this clip justice being exacted along the terms that in the Black--Blaxploitation vernacular made the most sense. But still, what kind of messages are being offered here?  And when you were in the movie theater, I mean the production value, the acting and such, you know, in the, the gun being pulled out of the afro, these are all humorous, but in the movie theater, these are moments of celebration. This is a whole different kind of cultural logic that people had not seen before, not on a screen, and they wanted to celebrate it.


Chapter 7. Stevie Wonder [00:42:40]

It's an era of great struggle for the nation, truly. We're still not out of that moment. And you'd see it articulated with its great cultural products of the age. It's a moment of despair, it¡¯s despair that¡¯s certainly likely what urged Stevie Wonder to write some of the most socially conscious lyrics of the era. And are--and these are, you won¡¯t be surprised, these are not the ones that are heard on the radio when people play back, you know, Stevie Wonder reflections.

Wonder had negotiated a new contract, just like Marvin Gaye had done before, that broke him out of the studio system in Motown, and re--and the result was about a six year cycle of albums that was nothing short of astonishing. I mean, one, that the albums are released, so many are released in just a five year window--actually, just a four year window when you think about it. Albums are Music on My Mind in 1972. He's only 21 years old. Talking Book released the same year, in seventy-two. Innervisions is released in seventy-three. Fulfillingness' First Finale in seventy-four, Songs in the Key of Life in seventy-six. This is not the Little Stevie Wonder of--he's coming out with Motown with--I'm forgetting the name of the song--playing his harmonica, but a Motown sort of dance tune. This is not the Stevie Wonder in later years of, you know, "Don't drive drunk," thing. This is Stevie Wonder of a different kind of political vintage. You can hear it here in this song "Big Brother."

Stevie Wonder:  Your name is big brother
You say that you got me all in your notebook,
Writing it down every day,
Your name is I'll see you,
Your name is I'll see you,

I'll change if you vote me in as a prince,
President of your soul
I live in the ghetto,
You just come to visit me 'round election time.
I live in the ghetto,
Someday I will move on my feet to the other side.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  The sound quality's much better. I had the settings off on this, I apologize. But in this song itself, he's going on,

You know, "I live in the ghetto,
Someday I will move on my feet to the other side,
My name is secluded,
we live in a house the size of a matchbox,
Roaches live with us wall to wall"

He concludes the song with,

"You've killed all our leaders.
I don't even have to do nothing to you;
You'll cause your own country to fall."

This is a different kind of Stevie Wonder, of course. Now, Wonder is using lyrics that are call and response to Jesse Jackson. Now we've not talked about Jesse Jackson pretty much at all in this course. We'll be talking about it, I think, next week. But Jackson has made a name for himself with a famous call and response, "I am somebody."  "I am," and the audience says, "Somebody."  Trying to boost up in these rallies sort of the notion of self esteem. And Wonder's saying, "No, my name is Nobody. My name is Secluded."  Incredible economic violence and despair. "You have killed all of our leaders. I don't have to do nothing to you to cause your own country to fall. The nation is going to collapse in upon itself. " 

So you have then across in the early years of the 1970s, and this lecture's really focused on about four years, three years, three or four years in the 1970s, a moment of incredible cultural production, but of a type that sends, well, a range of messages, I suppose. It's talking about black virility and at a moment of rising black feminism, which we¡¯ll be talking about on Wednesday, sends very interesting message, interesting in quotes, interesting not in a good way, messages about the role of the black woman. Still wrestling with tensions over who the man is, what the man looks like, what the man does. Who's to be blamed for the excesses?  In a sense, profoundly co--confusing messages about the cultural celebration of people who are putting drugs into the community and destroying that community. As you walk out, I'll be playing Village Ghetto Land from Wonder in 1976. He was inviting people to come with him down to his dead end street, 

"To Village Ghetto Land
See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals--from garbage cans (I think I missed a lyric, a line there)
Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plays--plagues the citizens
Unless they own police."

Not the most uplifting lecture, I know, but this is the cultural moment of the early 1970s. We'll overlap and we'll start talking about black feminism in the same moment and see a series of conflicting messages about blackness in the early 1970s. Class is over. <<inaudible>>

<<Stevie Wonder's Village Ghetto Land plays>>

Would you like to go with me
Down my dead end street
Would you like to come with me
To Village Ghetto Land 
See the people lock their doors 
While robbers laugh and steal 
¡¡¡¡Beggars watch and eat their meals--from garbage cans
¡¡¡¡Lecture 21 - The Politics of Gender and Culture (continued) [April 7, 2010]
¡¡¡¡Chapter 1. A Very Modern Articulation of a New Black Feminism [00:00:00]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Professor Jonathan Holloway:  I just realized a moment ago in looking at my notes that I was caught up in the rapture of this beautiful spring day and left, for the second time in as many weeks, a key set of documents in my office. That's okay. I'll manage one way or the other. So there's a moment when I go silent for about a minute, I'm reading that in my head, that, that part I left in my office. I want to begin with a very brief quote by an individual who takes up some important space towards the, towards the end of the lecture. This is by former U.S. representative Shirley Chisholm, and she says, "The emotional, sexual, and psychological stereotyping of female begins when the doctor says 'It's a girl.'" "The emotional, sexual, and psychological stereotyping of female begins when the doctor says 'It's a girl.'" 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now throughout the course, in an underlying sort of way, every now and again, we've been talking about, in a variety of different ways, gender dynamics in the American scene, whether it's the strange intermarriage--interesting choice of words--of race and, and sex and gender, when it comes to the figure of the black male rapist, or the black male brute, and white womanhood, vaunted womanhood. And certainly we've been hearing from our primary sources especially, a range of different women writers and thinkers and activists. Today I want to spend a lot of the lecture focusing on, on this particular moment in the early 1970s where you have a very modern articulation of a new black feminism.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So as you've been hearing from me in the last several lectures, it almost sounds like a drumbeat, I realize, that this is a complicated area. There's a lot of strife, there's a lot of confusion. Well, the fact simply is that it, that it is, and as this lecture's covering essentially the mid-1960s up to the mid-1970s, as we get into the 1970s, there's, there¡¯s no radical change in the idea of social complication. It's a period of profound unrest in the U.S. The economic up--euphoria of the 1960s--something I didn't mention: the economy's booming. I mean, this is part of the, the angry--the anger you hear in Gil Scott-Heron, in his spoken word performance, Whitey on the Moon. It's like, we're spending all this money sending--I mean it's expensive to pers--put a person on the moon, as it turns out. Yet in black America, we're not seeing any of this, this kind of benefit. So the sixties are a period of incredible economic prosperity for many parts of the United States. For many black urban dwellers, though, it's something quite different.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡When you get into the 1970s, though, the economic euphoria vanishes, and a new fiscal reality sets in that, that, that forces economists to think, to rethink old working models. You know things are supposed to act in a certain way. My goodness, they're not acting in a certain way. And they actually coined a phrase, a term for the new economic problems of the mid- and the late-1970s. That phrase is stagflation. In a stagnant economy, according to the models, means that you're not going to have inflation. In fact, you might have deflation. But you had a stagnant economy and inflation, and it's something that just hadn't happened before and it sort of defied a lot of the--of, of logic, but, you know, this is what happens when new logic models are proposed.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So fiscally, the country's heading into a wreck. It's also a period of psychological trauma as far as the mythological, mythological purity of America was concerned, the atrocities of war, and there's always atrocities, but now they're being brought home for the first time via the media's close involvement in the war, with the war in Vietnam. I mean, you have cameras, what we now--what we would now call them?, embedded, you know, journalists. You had cameras in the field, you--video and film, and the images are coming back on the nightly news, something that we don't see any more, frankly. That, that has been shut down. And it's been shut down because it was very effective at spreading dismay or anxiety, what the heck we are doing over in Vietnam. Why do our young me keep coming home in body bags? 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So with a heightened media presence, means you can't hide the fact that America's overwhelming military power found itself almost irrelevant in the face of North Vietnamese determination. The war is not going well, as you get into the late sixties and into the early seventies. You have a sitting president in the late sixites, LBJ, who declines to run for a second term in office. A shocking moment. You know, he took over when JFK was assassinated, won a first election, then had a chance to run for a second, and said no. The Republican Party, under Nixon, takes control with a pledge to the South, I mentioned in a previous lecture, with Strom Thurmond, that is going to ignore the civil rights gains of the preceding decade. Nixon runs on a law and order campaign.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Actually, a few of you came to Kathleen Cleaver¡¯s presentation last night, and she said something that's really quite striking, and I've heard it from many different people. And you'll, you¡¯ll hear it from me in a different way I suppose later on in this course in the time that remains, is that you look for those people like Kathleen Cleaver who were adults during Nixon's era. This is like, you know, the country can't get any worse as far as presidential leadership. But you look back at--[Student sneezes] Bless you--at the, at, at the Republican party politics under, under Nixon, and the country has shifted very far to the right, the arbitrary right, in terms of being much more conservative politically, that from the standpoint of many different political projects, Nixon is sounding really quite progressive in many areas compared to--you know, it doesn't matter who's in the office, Republican or Democrat. Clinton was a conservative Republican and Obama's a moderate--excuse me. What did I say?--conservative Democrat and, and Obama's a moderate Democrat, and Nixon on many issues, they had--they were on the same page, where Nixon was a little bit more liberal. It's, it¡¯s a weird kind of thing to say, but this is the record.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡In any event, Nixon's now in office, running under a law and order campaign, having gotten into office under, running, running underneath a law and order campaign. But he's not in office that long when the country's growing skepticism about its elected officials intensifies, once it learns about the break-in, break-ins at the Watergate, and the extent to which the cover ups were orchestrated by the White House, by Nixon himself. It's actually funny. This is around--I was born in 1967, and I remember watching live TV and thinking--well, I thought Nixon was the guy on the, on the dime. I didn't realize it was a different President, but the guy that looked like the guy on the dime, I knew he was in trouble. I didn't know what he did, and it was too much for my small brain to accommodate at the time, but my first political memory is of the impeachment hearings, dealing with, with Richard Nixon. People were fixated on the TV, what is the Congress going to do?  So growing out of this moment, we're talking here the early 1970s, the economy begins to tank, the military is humiliated, the political process becomes tainted at the highest levels and the country¡¯s, in a sense, is lost.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now many African Americans felt for a very long time that the country's innocence has, had been lost long before the 1970s. Black women in particular had an acute sense of disdain at the country's pronouncements about equality before the law and then the promise of the Civil Rights Movement. Black women suffer from what they called double jeopardy, being black and being female. Citizenship twice denied. For too long, freedom was equated with, in as far as the African American community is concerned, is equated with black manhood and the freedom of blacks, with the redemption of black masculinity. If we can help our brothers, then we'll all be free. Elaine Brown becomes the leader of the Black Panther Party in the early 1970s, once the founding leadership is either jailed, kicked out, or in exile.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Elaine Brown recalled an organizational meeting when she and other women were forced to wait to eat until the men were served food for which they all had contributed. The eth--ethos of the time was that, quote, this is Elaine Brown speaking here, "Sisters do not challenge brothers. Sisters stood behind their black men, supported their men, and respected them."  So even in an vanguard organization like the Black Panthers, a group that called for political and economic reorientation in American life and values, good old fashioned sexism is alive and well. Sexism of course is nothing new to the American scene. What was new was a rising articulation of modern feminism that is built upon the emotional power of the Civil Rights Movement. I imagine you've heard it many times before that you look at the great changes in women's politics, Chicano, Lat--Latino politics, Asian America politics, LGBTQ politics, they're growing out of the organizational skills really mastered by civil rights activists, women's, women¡¯s movement being the most, the earliest sort of, quote, other movement, building upon models of the Civil Rights Movement with great success.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 2. The Negro Family: The Case for National Action [00:10:00]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡In 1963, Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique. It became a tremendously important book, and it was essentially about how to get white, middle-class women out of the home and into the workplace. Without diminishing the importance of the book, it's, it¡¯s a landmark book. For black women, the book seemed, from sort of an argumentative standpoint, largely irrelevant, because black women had always been out of the home, in someone else's home actually, often as domestics. But they didn't have the leisure and the opportunity to be at home in a way that white middle-class women did. It's from an economic standpoint. So The Feminine Mys--Mystique is one of the first volleys of what will become sort of modern feminist movement, and right at the very beginning, black women are wondering, "Well where--How does this book apply to my experience?" 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡A couple of years later in 1965, black women and their sense of being ignored by major currents in American society are turned on its head in a weird way when they find themselves with the spotlight turned on them. Black women used to being ignored, and now the spotlight's on them, only this time they're not being blamed--only this time they're being blamed, excuse me, for black America's failures. At that moment, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, future senator, then part of the Department of Labor, published a report called The Negro Family: The Case for National Action. The report had charted black life in the United States. It spoke about the economic, political, and social deprivations that grew out of slavery and explored how being a disadvantaged minority affected the black family structure. Today, it's a tremendously important report, and it sets welfare policy standards for the next generation.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡I want to reduce the report to its simplest and most controversial essence. Although Moynihan lamented it, he said he felt that, he felt that there was nothing, nothing else to do but conclude that blacks were caught in a, quote, "tangle of pathology."  It¡¯s an important phrase. This tangle, moreover, was a result of women-headed households in black America. To illustrate this logic, I'm going to quote from the text, and I want you to listen here for the very clear investment in the norm of patriarchy here. Moynihan writes:
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    "That the Negro American has survived at all is extraordinary--a lesser people might simply have died out, as indeed others have. That the Negro community has not only survived, but in this political generation has entered national affairs as a moderate, humane, and constructive national force is the highest testament to the healing powers of the democratic ideal and the creative vitality of the negro people. But it may not be supposed that the Negro American community has not paid a fearful price for the incredible mistreatment to which it has been subjected over the past three centuries. In essence, the Negro community has been forced into a matriarchal structure which, because it is so out of line with the rest of the American society, seriously retards the progress of the group as a whole, and imposes a crushing burden on the Negro male and, in consequence, on a great many Negro women as well.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    There is, presumably, no special place--no, excuse me, no special reason why a society in which males are dominant in family relationships is to be preferred to a matriarchal arrangement. However, it is clearly a disadvantage for a minority group to be operating on one principle, while the great majority of the population, and the one with the most advantages to begin with, is operating on another. This is the present situation of the Negro. Ours is a society which presumes male leadership in private and public affairs. The arrangements of society facilitate such leadership and reward it. A subculture, such as that of the Negro American, in which this is not--in which this is not the pattern, is placed at a distinct disadvantage. Here an earlier word of caution is--should, should be repeated. There is much evidence that a considerable amount--There is much evidence that a considerable number of Negro families have managed to break out of the tangle of pathology and to establish themselves as stable, effective units, living according to patterns of American society in general."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡This is one excerpt from a much larger study, of course, and this is coming from an old fashioned Democrat, an old--a, a great liberal in the American tradition, lamenting the destruction of the black family, pointing to the fact that its matriarchal structure, the women-headed households, is the real reason behind, behind blacks' inability to have successful family units, because it's so out of line with the national norm of male-headed households. You know, it's great that blacks are so--have such strong backbones, they've been able to survive so much degradation, but we've got to find a way to solve this problem. It is a call for national action, which is the subtitle, The Case for National Action, the subtitle of the report. We need to solve the problem of the structure of the black family.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Black Americans are outraged by the report and its claim of an almost organic dysfunctionalism. This is not an anger that sought to deny the very obvious reality of poverty in the black community. No one could deny that. And also this anger is not a direct manifestation of the failure of Johnson's Great Society, and King's civil rights strategies to address abiding problems of poverty. People recognize the efforts that are being made in these regards. The anger is really a result of being considered a problem that America, and especially white America, had to solve. I mean think of this moment. This is the moment we're talking about. Moynihan's report comes out in sixty-five. Stokely Carmichael is talking about Black Power in sixty-six, and while Stokely Carmichael and, and his fellow travelers are a minority within black America, they're still getting a lot of attention, far more attention than their actual numbers would suggest.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡And to suggest--to hear then from an important figure in the federal government, saying, you know, "White Americans really have to solve this problem for black Americans. We need to find a solution," and sort of saying, you know, "It's really too bad, we've also been part of the problem, but we really can't address that issue. Let's try to fix this black family," just outraged black, black Americans. So according to Moynihan, blacks are a problem that white America had to resolve. Now you may or may not be surprised, as I've talked in this course about connections to events decades earlier and the way in which things don't change at times. You may not be surprised that W. E. B. Du Bois, having just passed away two years earlier, said as much the same thing in 1903, when he offered the following words in his landmark book, The Souls of Black Folk. And Du Bois said,
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    "Between me and the other world there is an ever unasked question: unasked by some through feelings of delicacy; by others through the difficulty of rightly framing it. All, nevertheless, flutter around it. They approach me in a half-hesitant sort of way, eye me curiously or compassionately, and then, instead of saying directly, 'How does it feel to be a problem?' they say, 'I know an excellent colored man in my town;' or, 'Do not these southern outrages make you--make your blood boil?' At these I smile, or am interested, or reduce the boiling to a simmer, as the occasion may require. To the real question, 'How does it feel to be a problem?' I answer seldom a word."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡This is a different age, 1965. This is a different age than Du Bois's in 1903. And instead of silence, black women begin to be heard on these kinds of issues that Moynihan's raising. Now please note, I'm not saying they begin to speak up. They're beginning to be heard. In the wake of the Moynihan report, groups across the country, individuals and groups, galvanize into action. There's a huge amount of scholarship published in the wake of the Moynihan report, in response to the Moynihan report, dealing with the sociology of the black family and, sort of, so-called black sociology.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 3. Johnnie Tillman: "Welfare is a Woman's Issue" [00:18:59]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡But on the activist front, people are outraged by sort of the blinders on Daniel Patrick Moynihan's opinions or thoughts or analyses, start forming groups of their own, and one of the key players in this process was a woman named Johnnie Tillman, a black woman, who had been on welfare herself, who helped organize the National Welfare Organization, the NWRO.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Tillman becomes one of the galvanizing figures of the NWRO, and really one of its spokespersons. Tillman defined poverty as the defining element in the lives of black women. Through her leadership at the NWRO, she pursued a practical agenda that called for decent wages, access to education and job training, medical care for women children, and children's daycare. They want decent wages, access to education and job training, medical care for women and children, and children's daycare. And the NR--excuse me, the NWRO also called for an end to abusive and degrading practices of welfare case workers who would, for example, show up at a welfare recipient's home at midnight, looking for evidence of other means of support. And most often, quote, other means of support, meant that an adult male was present. It was built into the structure of welfare policy of this era that suggestion--you see in Moynihan's ideology--that the norm should be patriarchal-headed family structure. That if there was a man around, it became much harder for a person on welfare to be able to claim that welfare.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Tillman made her dissatisfaction known in public rallies across the country. The title of one of her more frequent talks was, was Welfare is a Woman's Issue. It's a piece that ran in--that would eventually run in Gloria Steinem's breakout publication Ms.? published in 1972. I want to read an excerpt from that essay, a version of which she gave at many different rallies across the country. Welfare is a Woman's Issue, by Johnnie Tillman.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    "I'm a woman. I'm a black woman. I'm a poor woman. I'm a fat woman. I'm a middle-aged woman. And I'm on welfare. In this country, if you're any one of those things, you count less as a human being. If you're all those things, you don't count at all, except as a statistic. I am forty-five years old. I have raised six children. There are millions of statistics like me, some on welfare, some not. And some really poor, who don't even know they're entitled to welfare. Not all of them in black--are black, not all--not at all. In fact, the majority, about two-thirds of all poor families in the country, are white.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    Welfare's like a traffic accident. It can happen to anybody, but especially it happens to women. And that's why welfare is a women's issue. For a lot of middle-class women in this country, women's liberation is a matter of concern. For women on welfare, it's a matter of survival. Survival. That's why we had to go on welfare, and that's why we can't get off welfare now, not us women. Not until we do something about liberating poor women, women in this country, because up until now, we've been raised to expect to work all our lives for nothing, because we are the worst educated, the least skilled, and the lowest paid people there are; because we have to be almost totally responsible for our children; because we are regarded by everybody as dependents. That's why we are on welfare, and that's why we stay on it.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    Welfare is the most prejudiced institution in this country, even more than marriage, when it--which it tries to imitate. Let me explain that a little. Ninety-nine percent of welfare families are headed by women. There is no man around. In half the states there can't be a man around because AFDC (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) says if there is an "able-bodied" man around, then you can't be on welfare. If the kids are going to eat, and the man can't get a job, then he's got to go. Welfare is like a super-sexist marriage. You trade in a man for the man. But you can't divorce him if he treats you bad. He can divorce you, of course, cut you off anytime he wants. But in that case, he keeps the kids, not you. The man runs everything. In ordinary marriage, sex is supposed to be for your husband. On AFDC, you're not supposed to have any sex at all. You give up control of your own body. It's a condition of aid. You may even have to agree to get your tubes tied so you can never have more children just to avoid being cut off welfare.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    The man, the welfare system, controls your money. He tells you what to buy, what not to buy, where to buy it, and how much things cost. If things, rent, for instance, really cost more than he says they do, it's just too bad for you. He's always right. That's why Governor Ronald Reagan can get away with slandering welfare recipients, calling them, quote, "lazy parasites," "pigs at the trough," and such. We've been trained to believe that the only reason people are on welfare is because there's nothing wrong with their character. Sorry, I read that wrong. We¡¯ve been trained to believe that the only reason people are on welfare is because there¡¯s something wrong with their character. If people have motivation, if people only want to work, they can, and they will be able to support themselves and their kids in decency.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    The truth is a job doesn't necessarily mean an adequate income. There are some ten million jobs that now pay less than the minimum wage, and if you're a woman, you've got the best chance of getting one. Why would a forty-five-year-old woman work all day in a laundry ironing shirts at ninety-some cents an hour? Because she knows that there's some place lower she could be. She could be on welfare. Society needs women on welfare as examples to let every woman, factory workers and housewife workers alike, know what will happen if she lets up. If she's laid off, if she tries to go it alone without a man--I read that wrong as well. Society needs women on welfare as examples to let every woman, factory workers and housewife workers alike, know what will happen if she lets up, if, if she's laid off, if she tries to go it alone without a man. So these ladies stay on their feet or on their knees all their lives instead of asking why they're only getting ninety-some cents an hour, instead of daring to fight and complain."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Tillman carries this drumbeat with her to public rallies but also to private meetings. When, in 1968, she meets with Martin Luther King about welfare issues, she grows increasingly frustrated with King's interruptions and, in her view, evasions. She goes to King thinking, you know, "Here's a man who's really pledging himself to poverty reform or economic reform, addressing poverty," and then realizes that she's running into a stone wall in many ways. And finally Tillman says to King, "You know, Dr. King, if you don't know anything about these questions, you should say you don't know, and then we can go on with the meeting."  King was, like everybody is--and it's a meaningless phrase--a man of his time, but his own notion of patriarchal order was certainly well in place.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now Tillman and other NWRO activists linked welfare rights to civil rights, explaining that being on welfare was a necessity borne of the economic system, not of women's moral failings. So as where Moynihan and the, the Moy--the so-called Moynihan report is talking about structures of degradation and such, it is being driven by a moral assessment of women's role in the black family. And the NWRO takes out that moral assessment and looks at the structures of economic exploitation and lack of education and such.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 4. Milestones in the World of Politics [00:27:46]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now the NWRO represents one type of political thrust of the nine--late 1960s and early 1970s. It's important that we not lose sight of this grassroots rallies and activism, calling for structural changes when it comes to welfare, but it's also important to make note of a few different milestones in the world of politics. This is the detour that leads us to Shirley Chisholm.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now I spoke earlier about the fact when the Civil Rights Act became law, that there's this moment of great excitement, but very quickly, people understood it didn't address voting issues, and this was the real next, this was the next frontier. You'll also remember that when I talked about the Voting Rights Act becoming law, of course there were riots a few days later in Los Angeles, but looking ahead a few years, towards the end of the sixites, I said you would see a radical change in the numbers of voters. The Voting Rights Act, for all of its flaws of implementation and enforcement, did bear witness to a radical shift in the number of blacks who were now able to get access to the ballot box. And you start seeing that change, or you start seeing a change based on the number of blacks who were voting. 1967 was a landmark moment in terms of voting behaviors and it's actually only tangential--tangentially related, related to the Voting Rights Act, actually. The story unfolds in Cleveland.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Carl Stokes, a black man, is elected mayor of the city. He'd been a local figure for some time and member of the police force, very prominent certainly. He's not the first black mayor ever, but he's the first black mayor--first black elected mayor of a major city. Now what's critically important to think about in Stokes's case is that blacks are actually the minority of the population in Cleveland. [Student sneezes]  Bless you. Stokes becomes really the first successful coalition politician at that level in the country's history. He runs on a strong law and order campaign that appealed to a real segment of the population, conservative and liberal, certainly. You know, leans on his past record as a police officer. He appeals to the black community simply because here's a black man who's going to stand up and, and the assumption is he's going to speak for us, on our behalf. But he really pulls in liberal whites as well, and through a complicated sort of dance, forms a coalition, white and black voters, becomes the mayor.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡His campaign is watched very closely, and it becomes a model for other black morality campaigns across the country. You start seeing black mayors popping out. Gary, Indiana, just around the bend, in Los Angeles, California, soon enough. You start seeing the beginnings of the era of the black mayor, in our urban landscape. And as the voting rights--the, the voting numbers start to skyrocket for African Americans, you start seeing blacks elected to offices in, in regions of the country they had not ever been elected, largely in the Southeast. Two years after Carl Stokes is elected the mayor of Cleveland, you actually have, as a result of an increasing number of blacks going to Congress, a new group formed called the Congressional Black Caucus, still alive and very well today.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡The Congressional Black Caucus, the CBC is formed. And essentially now we have a critical mass, still on the small side, but a critical mass, of black elected officials, House representatives, and then one in the Senate at that time, who are going to come together on agendas that we think we share--on which we share common ground. Will they always be race agendas?  Ah, you know, I guess that's the presumption, but there could be common ground on other issues. It will form like a political action group. That's essentially what the caucus is. So you have a rising number of people who are in--holding positions of power in formal elected offices, and you have the continuation of grassroots activism on the ground.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡In 1972, and as the snowball's rolling down the mountain, a number of activists and elected officials get together, saying, you know,  "We've got a real moment of opportunity here. We're calling for change."  There are groups like the NWRO, not just--that's not an all-black group; I should have made that clear, it's a multiracial group. But you have this group on the ground, other groups like that on the ground, small political action groups in, in cities across the country. You have black militants, certainly. You have still the black leaders of churches. That's been there for a long time. But now you have these black mayors and these black elected officials and, and House representatives. Here's a moment where we need to take advantage of, of our collective experience as African Americans, come together and try to forge a new voice, a new black political voice. So they call for a convention. The National Black Political Convention is held in 1972 in Gary, Indiana.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡It's a meeting of black radicals, nationalists, and mainstream politicians, and it has the convention theme of unity without uniformity. And this is now where I spend a couple of minutes reading excerpts from the, from the platform and from Amiri Baraka, a radical black poet, from his poem called It's Nation Time, that is rather an aggressive assertion of black militancy and black nationalism. And I'll read these two excerpts, trust me on this, where you have, you know, this, this--and, and Baraka's one of the organizers of this, of this meeting. He had this very ardent black militant voice, you know, with a poem laced with shotguns, and racial epithets, and, and, and challenges to religious orthodoxies that "it's nation time, it's nation time," is really, you know, what this--he's calling for in the poem. And you have the host of the convention, like Gary Hatcher, mayor of--it's not Gary Hatcher--the Mayor Hatcher of Gary, Indiana, Richard Hatcher, saying, "Look, we've got to find a way to bridge the differences," because he's not going to stand on a platform of--and I'm paraphrasing from Baraka's phone--poem, "Niggers get your guns."  He's not going to stand on that platform. We don't want to lose this opportunity--this organizing opportunity, and emphasizes, "We need to have unity and understand we cannot be uniform," harking back to the organizing theme of the conference.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 5. Shirley Chisholm Declares her Candidacy for President [00:35:32]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now the National Black Political Convention, what does it leave us with?  It leaves with no clear message. Think back to the National Negro Congress, some forty--thirty-five, thirty-six years earlier, same kind of situation where the coalition of different kinds of black voices come together, with an unclear result. But now these people are elected into office. The National Black Political Convention exposes the diversity of political opinions within black America. It does that. And a group grows out of it, the National Black Political Assembly. And some thought that the National Black Political Assembly--essentially like the Congressional Black Caucus, but now operating at all levels of political organization in society, grassroots up to the House of Representatives--some thought that this was an incredible, going to be an incredible, incredible vehicle to create real change. And one of the people who thought it was going to create change was Shirley Chisholm, representative from Brooklyn, and the first woman to represent New York state in the U.S. Congress.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Chisholm has just declared her candidacy for the presidency of the United States and looked to the activists involved in the Gary convention, the National Black Political Convention, looked to the activists at the convention for their support. Chisholm's growing out of the tradition now of someone like Carl Stokes. She's a real coalition politician. She was--this was rad--this was controversial at the time, she was a very public member of the National Organization for Women, a group that black feminists thought was just for white women, something I'll get to a little bit later on as I close out the lecture. So Shirley Chisholm has a whole bunch of support, it seems, from people like Gloria Steinem, who published Johnnie Tillman's essay about welfare.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡But then something funny happens--not funny ha-ha, funny unfortunate--is that as Chisholm goes around the floor of the Gary convention, as she starts seeking support from her white feminist friends, the cold, hard reality of politics invaded. Black elected officials distanced themselves immediately from Chisholm, because they believed that her president--her presidential campaign was an absolute--an absolute long shot, and they wanted to align themselves with more likely Democratic contenders for the national party's nomination. A crushing blow comes from Chisholm when she overhears, at another black political conference, these two officials. She¡¯s--I guess she's just within earshot. One of them says to the other, two black men, "There she is. That little black matriarch who goes around messing things up." 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So you have rising black political organizations in the high form of politics, a connection, it seems, to the grassroots activism that you see in groups like the NWRO. Shirley Chisholm tapping into this moment, like this will be the moment we can really forge change in this country. And like someone--I mean Chisholm wasn't running on a women's platform, per se; she's running on, running on a liberal politics platform, but she was seen as unelectable by black elected officials, and also by the women in groups like NOW. They cast their support to the more mainstream, quote, mainstream Democratic contenders. So Shirley Chisholm seems as a complete affirmation of this double jeopardy status of black women in the United States. You know, because she's black, she's going to be discounted, because she's  woman, she's going to be discounted. Just depends on who's doing the discounting.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡And Chisholm wasn't the only person to feel this way. In 1973, a year after the National Black Political Convention, a group is formed called the National Black Feminist Organization, the NBFO. And it sets about to criticize the stereotypes of black women, criticize the country for caring more about black men. As long as the brothers are taken care of, the sisters will be taken care of eventually. The NBFO activists took issue with the media for imposing standards of beauty that are purely anglo--anglophile. The NBFO addressed practical issues, like the NRO--NWRO did, like child welfare, unemployment, etcetera. And it, the, the National Black Feminist Organization added, in its ideology, something that had really been solely the domain of white feminist movement to that point, namely abortion rights and equal rights amendment. It is an organization with an ideologically broad umbrella on feminist issues, broader in its opinion than the National Organization for Women.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now the NBFO, perhaps predictably, was met with a strong backlash. It was accused of hampering the black movement, in air quotes, the black movement, is accused of hampering it. You know, getting people confused about what's the real voice of black America. Is accused of being man-hating, in part--in large part because it welcomed lesbians into its organizations, publicly. Now all of the NBFO collapses, almost as quickly as it's formed. It does not last long. It exposed a range of hot button issues within the black community and inspired other groups to form, most famously, the Combahee River Collective. I want to turn quickly to the Combahee River Collective statement, the collective statement, and point, to some--point to some of these hot button issues. The statement reads that,
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    "We are a collective of black feminists who have been meeting together since 1974, involved in the process of defining and clarifying our politics, while doing political work within our own group and in coalition with other progressive organizations and movements. We see black feminism as the logical political movement to combat the manifold and simultaneous oppression that all women of color face."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡It goes into the genesis of contemporary black feminism, and then has three points of what we believe, the problems in organizing black feminists, and black feminist issues and projects. And I'm excerpting here. "What We Believe," the statement says,
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    "Although we are feminists and lesbians, we feel solidarity with progressive black men and do not advocate the fractionalization that white women who are separatists demand. We struggle together with black men against racism, while we also struggle with black men about sexism. We are socialists because we believe that work must be organized for the collective benefit of those who do the work and create the products, and not for the profit of the bosses. We need to articulate the real class situation of, of persons for whom racial and sexual oppression are significant determinants in their working, economic lives."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Calling on the recognition of problems in organizing black feminists, the Combahee River Collective says that,
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    "The major source of difficulty in our political work is that we are trying to address a whole range of oppressions. We are dispossessed psychologically and on every other level, and yet we feel the necessity to struggle to change the condition of all black women. If black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be free, since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all the systems of oppression."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Again, that notion of multiple forms of, of oppression weighing down on blackness and, and female--women, womanhood. And it says in terms of "Black Feminist Issues and Projects," is one of the,
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    "One issue that is of major concern to us, and that we have begun to publicly address, is racism in the white women's movement."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡I made reference to this earlier, Shirley Chisholm's sort of confront--what am I looking?  Wow, just completely drew a blank on a very basic word--controversial, on her controversial membership in the National Organization for Women. In the successful rise of the, the feminist movement, black women start telling stories of trying to affiliate with what are essentially white groups. And the stories they start to tell are rather--stories of great frustration, and they, they¡¯re, they replicate themselves constantly. Black woman going into a meeting of local N--NOW activists and having her voice being the only voice that's silenced, or having black organization, a women's organization, trying to affiliate with the white women's organization, and the white activists trying to take over the black women's organization. Presump--presumption of who knows best.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So the Combahee River Collective, the National Black Feminist Organization before it as well, and people like Shirley Chisholm, all recognizing that there is something flawed, even in women's rights organizations, and it's, it¡¯s the racial dynamic. So you have a rising sense of black feminist political awareness and determination to change the conversation. Shirley Chisholm was certainly frustrated, but she's committed to change. In this era, on the political front, you see a reflection of that commitment to change, where the number of black women who are elected officials skyrockets from fifteen percent of the black elected officials are women in the late sixties, to nearly sixty percent by the end of the 1970s. A humongous change in who's representing this constituency, presumptively but not always representing a black constituency.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now as I did on Monday, I was talking about the incredible cultural power of the moment, and the interesting narratives of misogyny and hyper-masculinity you see in Blaxploitation films. This is also an era that you see the beginning of an incredible renaissance in black women's literature especially. The great author Toni Morrison appearing on the scene with The Bluest Eye in 1970. Alice Walker, who would become most famous for writing Colored--ha-ha, I just noticed here, in my typing these notes here, I wrote, I wrote Colored People--The Color Purple. Just noticed that big old typo. Anyway, Alice Walker, who published that book in 1982, but in the seventies, she was doing an incredible amount of recovery work. For example, who¡¯s, who here has heard of Zora Neale Hurston?  I mean pretty much everybody. None of your hands would have gone up prior to the nine--early 1970s. And the hands are being raised now because of Alice Walker's, essentially, detective work. She makes it her mission, for example, to discover Zora Neale Hurston's grave, unmarked. Zora Neale Hurston had this incredible moment in the, in the late thirties and forties, but disappears. She dies penniless, she¡¯s working as a maid, her writing disappears.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Alice Walker discovers it and makes an attempt, a concerted effort, to bring her back into the literary conversation in American letters, and does it quite successfully. And she's recognizing, Alice Walker is, in this recuperative work, dealing with Zora Neale Hurston, that this new voice, or in Zora Neale Hurston's case, an older voice, but a new way of listening to this voice. It's about black women who wanted to declare political engagement on their own terms, not men's, not black men's, and not white women's. And Walker calls for a new term that would apply to black women in general and that's womanist. A womanist politics is a black feminist politics. Walker, when asked to comment on the combination of events over the previous decades that open up the possibilities for black women, she said, speaking of her characters, said
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    "My women in the future will not burn themselves up. Now I am ready to look at women who have made the room larger for others to move in. I think one reason I never stay away from the southern movement is because I realize how deeply political changes affect the choices and lifestyles of people. The movement of the sixties, Black Power, the Muslims, the Panthers, have changed the options of black people generally and of black women in particular, so that my women characters won't all end the way they have been, because black women now offer the varied, live models of how it possible to live. We have a new place to move." 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡And move they did. We will pick up discussion on next Monday. Thank you.

¡¡¡¡afam-162: African American History: From Emancipation to the Present
¡¡¡¡Lecture 22 - Public Policy and Presidential Politics [April 12, 2010]
¡¡¡¡Chapter 1. Introduction: The Political Biography of Jesse Jackson [00:00:00]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Professor Jonathan Holloway: Good morning, everybody. Last week we covered the cultural politics of the early 1970s and also the rise of different types of politics in the, in the, sort of the, this--think of a word that actually--in a bowl, a cauldron of politics in the early 1970s, whether it's grassroots affairs, high politics with the Congressional Black Caucus, and running throughout all of, all of that, the complications imposed by, by a commitment to formal modes of political engagement, while you have someone like Shirley Chisholm coming along. So you see the way in which gender is this fault line when it comes to race politics in the nation in the early 1970s. And it¡¯s been a fault line for the longest time, of course. What I want to do today is cover chronologically a lot of the same time period, but through, through a biography.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡One person I've not really mentioned much at all in the course in the last few weeks, but who's becoming incredibly important as we go through the 1970s and into the 1980s, is Jesse Jackson. So I want to focus on this sort of political biography of this person as a way to help us understand, maybe even summarize really, the shifting cultural politics of the 1960s, of the rise of a different array of politics in the 1970s, and then heading us into really what is this week is mainly about, is high, high, high politics as far, in, in, in the--as the way they are expressed through presidential politics. So basically, at any given moment, you could go through high, low, medium levels of politics. This week, we'll be moving from the grassroots through Jesse Jackson, up through the highest echelons of power in the United States. Now last Monday, I concluded the lecture playing an excerpt from Stevie Wonder--Stevie Wonder's song "Big Brother" from 1972. One of the lines--I don't expect you to remember it--he's talking about "My name is Nobody," and saying you, the person listening, the man, "your name is Big Brother."  And I mentioned last Monday how that's actually a harkening to Jesse Jackson's own politics, and you'll see this coming out in the middle of today's lecture. So this is just to point out these are overlapping time periods.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So Jesse Jackson. The most basic biography, starting with him as a college student. He graduates from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University down in, in Greensboro, North Carolina. Same school where, before he matriculated, four young men marched into Woolworth's and started the famous bus boycott--excuse me, the sit-in movement. So Jackson, although not politically engaged when he gets to campus, knows that he's arrived at a place that is suffused with now a young but very vibrant history of political engagement in the student politics of the era. He goes through A&T, graduates, and while he's in college, finally decides to answer a call he'd been struggling with for a long time, and that's a call to faith. So he goes to Chicago Theological Seminary. He's in seminary when the SNCC marchers, led by John Lewis, get attacked by the police and it turns into Bloody Sunday. He leaves Chicago--this is sixty-five, of course--he leaves Chicago and heads down to Selma. You know, he is like thousands of other African American, white, brown, whatever, individuals who come to Selma to try to be part of the solution.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡He's in Alabama, and he joins other young civil rights workers on the ground, you know, a number of whom have gone on to great fame and then also infamy. People like Marion Barry, the former mayor of Washington, D.C., for example, was a fantastically important activist, civil--student, civil rights activist during this era. Jackson, in the midst of these other clearly talented people, he still stands out. More than anything else, he stands out because of his ability to speak. He is, you know, whatever you might think of his politics, he is clearly one of the great, one of the great speakers in our, in our moment, in our lives. And essentially, he talks his way, though sheer force of will and charisma, he talks his way into the inner-circle of leaders. He's no longer just a foot soldier down there, trying to complete this march from Selma to Montgomery. He sees himself really having an important role to play in the inner-circle. And in short notice, he's actually now in King's inner-circle, so he's right around the leader of this moment. Very early on, there begins to be whispers about Jesse Jackson: a little bit too good to believe; an incredible opportunist; you know, unbridled ambition. And these are all, you know, concerns that have followed Jackson throughout his entire political career, of course, but they're starting at that very moment.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 2. Jesse Jackson Forms Operation Breadbasket [00:06:07]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡The SCLC--[Student sneezes] bless you--The SCLC, sensing that they've got somebody special in their midst who can really make a difference, is engaged in something, sends him back to Chicago. And the leadership of the SCLC, King included--[Student sneezes] bless you. [pauses] Oh I thought I heard another sneeze coming, it is allergy season, after all--they see Jackson as a person who can sort of establish a beachhead for SCLC, dealing with economic issues. Now remember, S--SCLC heads to Chicago in sixty-six, so Jackson is sent there to sort of pave the ground and get things set up. What he does when he gets there is sets up a group called Operation Breadbasket, and it is a, a group underneath SCLC's umbrella. Operation Breadbasket is solely based in Chicago and with Jackson's great charisma and power, he starts having great success, and starts developing real, real powerful leadership networks, kinships in Chicago. Now what was Operation Breadbasket all about? 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡It was about trying to diversify business opportunities and service in the black community in Chicago. This is a highly segregated city, very large and densely packed neighborhood in the south side of Chicago. It's much more than a neighborhood. And Jackson uses a strategy he's, he¡¯s maintained for decades, that's the economic boycott. So Operation Breadbasket is organized around the idea, we will boycott, we'll gather together black consumer purchasing power, and we will boycott Chicago companies that don't conduct better business practices in, in--business practices--practices in black communities. Because Jackson has been so successful at getting people together, I mean, Operation Breadbasket is doing all the classic things that, that civil rights groups are doing, have done, throughout the breadth of this course. I mean they're also, you know, putting food on people's tables, they're providing job banks, they're basic--doing basic education.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡The company's quickly concede because Operation Breadbasket is, is, it¡¯s working, and so you see companies start hiring black managers. This is important. I mean this is different than the boycotts in the past, like A. Philip Randolph was threatening, where he's trying to get as many black workers on the factory floor, thinking back to the defense industry jobs in World War II. Jackson is going at the management level. He's goes, "We can hire all the black factory workers we want, but there will be a glass ceiling. You won't break into management. You won't run the business or franchise."  That's what Jackson¡¯s targets--targets. Companies recognize what's going on and realize they'd better get on board, so they start hiring black managers. Jackson then, with the support of SCLC, takes Operation Breadbasket national. It's going to be part of a national economic engagement with race politics. Clearly, Jackson's star is rising. It's up in Chicago in late sixty-five and by early sixty-eight, Operation Breadbasket, that he started for the SCLC, is going national. Then Martin Luther King is assassinated. The great prince has been slain.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now, in the moment of an assassination, people do all kinds of things that are--you know, we can overanalyze til we're blue in the face--they do things they don¡¯t really, can't really quite explain. But Jackson, Jackson was kind of curious. He's there when King is assassinated. I can't imagine that kind of horror. And for days afterward, cameras would be following Jackson and other civil rights leaders, just trying to, you know, get a pulse on what's happening, not just in Memphis but around the nation as cities burn. And Jackson's wearing the same clothes that he was wearing when King was assassinated. He's dazed; everybody's dazed, there's no doubt about that. But Jackson's clothes were particularly noteworthy, because they're blood-stained. They had King's blood on his chest. Now Jackson was right there, there's blood going to be everywhere. Certainly you can excuse him for not changing clothes for a few days.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡And then this is where things get interesting, is that people start grousing. Jackson said he's going, you know, he¡¯s going down to King's body to try to stop the bleeding. He had blood on his shirt--hands, and just wiped it on his shirt without thinking about it. It's a natural kind of reaction. Others start saying Jackson deliberately put his hands in King's blood and deliberately wiped it on his shirt. Now I have no idea what is true, but the fact is, this is the level of the conversation within sort of closer circles around King, trying to understand, what the heck is Jackson doing?  So you see Jackson with the bloody shirt then, being caught in this interpretative moment. Is he a symbol--is his bloody shirt a symbol of the nation's guilt, or was the blood on Jackson's shirt a symbol of his own anointment of his leadership status within black America? 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now helping understand some of that really aggressive critique of Jackson, people thought, you know, what, you know, "What's he actually doing here?"  It's important to understand that when SCLC sent Jackson up to be an economic--set the, the groundwork in Chicago, a number of them were just trying to get him out of the South. The man wouldn't stop talking, apparently, and King, some--according to some reports, like, "Just get this kid out of here. Send him to Chicago."  You know, "Have him do something."  No one expected him to succeed, but he does succeed. And his success burnishes his ego, which is certainly substantial. And of--without great surprise, his great success also causes friction. Nothing breeds contempt like success, after all. So as Operation Breadbasket continues to grow, as Jackson seems to declare himself, if not the, then one of the most important leaders in black America after King's assassination. And there's certainly enough confusion where that kind of claim would make sense. It becomes clear that SCLC and Operation Breadbasket are not going to succeed; they're not going to survive together. Too many bulls in the china shop.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 3. Jesse Jackson Forms Operation PUSH [00:14:02]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So Jackson takes, or splits, from SCLC in 1971 and forms another operation, Operation PUSH. Now you may remember, thinking back to, I don¡¯t know, a month and a half ago in the course, a month ago in the course, that after the success of the Montgomery bus boycott, King was thinking, you know, what, what's the next thing for him to do, and Bayard Rustin says, "You've got to have an organization to capitalize on this energy, and Bayard Rustin wanted it to be called the Southern Leadership Conference, and King changed the name to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Well Jackson splits and forms Operation PUSH, People United to Save Humanity. It's what the original title is. People United to Save Humanity, and it's a perfect example of Jackson's sense of himself, that he can lead an organization that will save humanity, but he had advisers as well, say, you know, "Jesse, that's a bit, that¡¯s a bit much. Heck, you're not even thirty years old yet."  So the name of the operation was changed before it went public to Operation PUSH, People United to Serve Humanity, much more in the spirit with the Christian ethos that Jackson stood for.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So Operation PUSH is Chicago-based. This is Jackson's bedrock, his organizing center. Its goal is very much like Operation Breadbasket, which is black empowerment. And through Operation PUSH, Jackson essentially becomes the black ambassador to white corporate America. This is going through the 1970s. You know, think of this moment, we¡¯re, we're past the black political assembly. We, you now had the Congressional Black Caucus formed. You have real power, people in positions of political power in Congress. You have the angry activists, of course, certainly, and you have Jesse Jackson, who's somewhere in between. He can speak and rally a black mass like nobody else can, truly. But he also knew how to massage, quote, the system, and talk to white business managers and corporations, first in Chicago and then ultimately nationally. He was very successful.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So he goes to huge corporations now, Coca-Cola, Anheuser, excuse me, Anheuser-Busch, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Burger King. He's going to these businesses, knowing that there was a disproportionate amount of black purchasing power related to these corporations and their products. And he threatens a national boycott of all of these brands, unless blacks begin to give--begin to receive leadership roles in these organizations. This is now--we're, we've now traversed the 1970s. Now we're in 1981. Corporations say, you know, "We know who Jesse Jackson is, but please, we are not worried about this."  You know, "This is a little bit embarrassing, and it's true, we don't have any blacks in management positions in the comp--in these huge companies, essentially none, but we're not going to worry about it."  The boycotts are called. And I remember the Coca-Cola boycott, mainly because I liked Coca-Cola when I able to get it--when I was able to get it and because--and this is actually more to the point--Coca-Cola owns Minute Maid orange juice. I loved Minute Maid orange juice, and all of a sudden, it was gone in my house.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now I did not grow up in a family of black militants. I grew up in a family, my, my father can't stand Jesse Jackson, almost personally. I really don't know the, the, the, the source of the bile, but he just can't stand him. But the boycott made sense to my parents. So replacing my beloved Minute Maid orange juice was this--I think it's still made--this really bitter, nasty Donald Duck orange juice. It was just horrible. So I felt rather aggrieved by the boycott myself. But the boycott was incredibly successful, actually, and especially with Coke and all of its products. Coke starts losing money rapidly, and Coke says, "Well, we've got to, we¡¯ve got to fix this," and they start targeting black business leaders in various communities to start buying--allowing them to buy franchises, you know, the local bottling franchise, for instance. And then a funny thing happens. Once Coke changes its agenda, its, its tactic regarding this boycott, and starts bringing in black managers and franchisees, they start making money hand over fist. They're embraced by the black community even more so than before, and they start realizing, "Hey, you know, there's something to this."  And so Coke becomes a model, to a certain extent, which is very important, to a certain extent, of developing a black consumer base. In fact you have, during this moment, in the wake of Blaxploitation films, who are realizing, "My god, there's a lot of money to be made in black America." 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡You have corporations sort of waking up and realizing, "There is a huge market we have not bothered pursuing."  You know, whether they're high minded about civil rights or citizenship rights, it doesn¡¯t matter. This is about the almighty dollar, so corporations start aggressively courting black America and if, in the case of Coca-Cola, that meant hiring black managers, we're going to do it. Now, the caveat to all of this is that the glass ceiling still remains there. It's just a little higher up. And this would become a case of great bitterness, this phenomenon, as we go through the 1980s into the 1990s, as this first generation of black managers, and women managers as well, start trying to move further up in the hierarchy, and they're stopped. You actually have lawsuits following in Coca-Cola. Texaco was quite famous in the, in the mid-to-late-1990s as well, for a very powerful, powerfully coherent glass ceiling. But in the early '80s, some things changed, and Jesse Jackson is the person who led that change.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 4. Jesse Jackson Runs for President [00:21:21]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now the success of the boycott with Coca-Cola and other corporations inspires Jackson to do something more. He's going to run for presidential office. He runs in 1984, and it's largely a symbolic campaign, that is practically scuttled from the start by Jackson's loose sort of "politics makes strange bedfellows" affiliation with Louis Farrakhan from the Nation of Islam. And, also, for an unfortunate remark that Jackson made himself, referring to, sort of one of these passing comments, probably made because he was quite tired. He referred to New York City as "Hymietown."  That would be akin to calling Washington, D.C., "Niggerville" in people's minds. The mayor of New York City, Ed Koch, is infuriated by the comment, for good reason, no doubt. And although Jackson apologize--apologizes right away, the mayor wouldn't let up. He just keeps hammering away: this is who Jackson, Jesse Jackson, really is. Now we really know what's up with this particular individual. And to make it worse, he's associated with Farrakhan, sympathetic to the Palestinians. You know, the whole thing's wrapped up in this one moment. Again, Jackson apologized for the remark as quickly as he could, and said, famously, "God isn't finished with me yet. I'm far from perfect."  But the slur wiped out his campaign.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡In eighty-eight, he decides to run again. This time he--it is not a symbolic campaign, not by a long shot. He's distanced himself from Farrakhan. He's much more politically polished as far as, sort of, national presidential politics are concerned. And in fact, in eighty-eight, he terrifies the Democratic leadership when he starts beating their people, their likely candidates. Now I know it sounds like no big deal in the age of Obama, in his fantastic run in 2008, but we have to forget that for a moment, go back twenty years. And after Jackson wins the Michigan primary, he's actually the front runner of the Democratic campaign. It's early on, but people thought, "The--Wait, hold, stop a second!  I mean, it was cute when he boycotted Coke, you know, and his various antics over time are, you know, inspirational, certainly, but this is serious now. He's a Democratic front--frontrunner for a series of primaries." 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now what's the change between eighty-four and eighty-eight?  The big change is that, aside from being more polished, is that Jackson really masters something that Carl Stokes had done twenty years earlier in Cleveland, and he builds a coalition that hadn¡¯t been seen at the presidential level be--had never been seen at the presidential level before, through the Rainbow Coalition, this organization that he also heads up. He reaches out through the Rainbow Coalition to people of all kinds of aggrieved backgrounds. You know, blacks, of course, are going to be his strongest base, people working in labor unions, people trying to organize into labor unions, the agricultural workers, reaching out to women, to the poor. And then during this moment of great dawning awareness of the AIDS crisis, HIV and AIDS crisis, he's reaching out to people suffering from HIV and reaches out to the homosexual community, something that was quite shocking for Jackson. He reaches out to the disabled. And he pulls them all together in this great quilt, is the metaphor he uses a lot, and says that he speaks for everybody.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now Jackson does not win the nomination, Dukakis does. But Jackson, of course, earns a spot on the convention floor, and his speech--and in, in prime time, which is one of the major things you want. And his speech on the convention floor is considered one of the classics of the genre. He reaches out during the course of his speech to the coalition I just talked to you about. Talks about this great quilt to be made of everyone's separate patches. He criticizes Ronald Reagan aggressively, especially his--or especially his, what he refers to as Reaganomics, a system of economic reform that radically cut taxes to the wealthy and the idea that they would get a lot more money and they would invest more in society, and then it would trickle down, the investments, to the middle and working-classes, trickledown economics, something that Jesse Jackson thought had ravished, ravaged the American economy and the working-class in particular. And he sees Reaganomics as quite morally bankrupt.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡And I want to play for you a clip from the Dem--the, the, the nomination speech--the convention speech, excuse me. And you have the actual, you know, a version of this speech in the, in the reader, I know, but it is also important to hear people, speakers like Jesse Jackson, for the way in which the great--they carry on the great oral tradition of, sort of, the black minister, the black vernacular tradition. And partly, that great black vernacular tradition allows someone like Jackson to access the language of morality and, in this case, immorality, what he sees in the current state of affairs. Now you'll see during--unfortunately, during a highlight moment of his speech, this is on CSPAN and so they are obliged to show the crowd, and they linger for a very long time over two people who were then a lot more culturally relevant in a celebrity sort of way than they are now, Ally Sheedy and one of the Baldwin, one of the other Baldwin brothers. Actually don't remember which one it is. But, but, so just, you know, kind of visually ignore that and, and listen to what Jackson is saying here.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    Rev. Jesse Jackson:  Leadership must meet the moral challenge of its day. What's the moral challenge of our day? We have public accommodations. We have the right to vote. We have open housing. What's the fundamental challenge of our day? It is to end economic violence. Plant closings without notice, economic violence. Even the greedy do not profit long from greed, economic violence. Most poor people are not lazy. They are not black. They are not brown. They are mostly white and female and young. But whether white, black, or brown, a hungry baby's belly turned inside out is the same color. Color it pain; color it hurt; color it agony.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    Most poor people are not on welfare. Some of them are illiterate and can't read the want-ad sections. And when they can, they can't find a job that matches the address. They work hard every day. I know. I live amongst them. I'm one of them. I know they work. I'm a witness. They catch the early bus. They work every day. They raise other people's children. They work every day. They clean the streets. They work every day. They drive dangerous cabs. They work every day. They change the beds you slept in, in these hotels last night, and can't get a union contract. They work every day. No, no, they are not lazy! Someone must defend them because it's right, and they cannot speak for themselves. They work in hospitals. I know they do. They wipe the bodies of those who are sick with fever and pain. They empty their bedpans. They clean out their commodes. No job is beneath them, and yet when they get sick, they cannot lie in the bed they made up every day. America, that is not right. We are a better nation than that. We are a better nation than that.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 5. The Political and Social Milieu around President Nixon and Ford¡¯s Administrations [00:31:54]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Professor Jonathan Holloway:  So you'll see in this, this clip here, that Jackson is talking about, is engaging the economic issues of the day and linking it to what he sees as a moral failing of the leadership of the, of the moment. Jackson is speaking against--in addition to, I¡¯m sorry, this economic logic that was a sort of reverse Robin Hood, this trickledown economics, he's also speaking about a culture of covert racial politics that has come to define much of the 1980s. Now, doing a quick survey, going backwards now to the early 1970s, President Nixon is in office. But due to culture of paranoia that's in the White House, his whole presidency goes up in flames in Watergate. Gerald Ford is brought into office, after Nixon's, former President, had to be let go. Nixon was actually pretty good on affirmative action issues, but used--in terms of trying to create job opportunities for African Americans--but he used it in a rather vicious way, as a wedge issue, to sort of break apart blacks and labor unions, labor unions being, having a very troubled relationship to affirmative action, because it disrupted the, the, the traditions of seniority.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So Nixon uses affirmative action as a tactic. Ford comes in office and he's better on civil rights, but overall a lukewarm presidency on civil rights issues. And he's really, I mean as it turns out, a transitional President.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 6. The Political and Social Milieu around President Jimmy Carter¡¯s Administration [00:33:53]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡And then this mystery from Plains, Georgia, Jimmy Carter, former governor of Georgia, sort of comes out of the blue, a very moderate Democrat, who now, as our politics have gotten more conservative in this country, looks like some kind of crazy liberal often. But he's a very moderate Democrat. And actually, on, on, on racial issues, he's actually pretty progressive, speaking of a southern tradition of governors, certainly. Carter is able to speak to black America, unlike previous Presidents had been able to. He wins huge black vote, ninety percent of the black vote; five point two million blacks vote for Carter. He wins by one point seven million votes. Now whenever people talk about this population, that population, got someone elected into office, I mean, you can cut and slice the statistics any way you can, but the belief was certainly there that the black vote delivered Carter into the White House. And there was an expectation of return.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So while Jesse Jackson's organizing economic boycotts and, and developing into the star that he would be--really become, Carter is wrestling over how to diversify the executive branch of the federal government. He starts making numerous appointments, African Americans. Fifteen ambassadors are now black; thirty federal judges, fifty--fifty sub-Cabinet officials, a hundred and ten members of advisory boards, twenty-five members of the White House staff. These are numbers that no one had seen before. And we really are--I mean there's a statistic that's, that¡¯s worth keeping in mind. We aren't out of the woods when it comes to thinking about numbers and race in political office, by the way. In 1972, we have the first time in seventy years that you have a, a black person elected to Congress from the South. So there's no black representation from the South in Congress, from the turn of the twentieth century into 1972, right before Carter takes office. It would be another twenty years, not until 1992, that North Carolina and Georgia send a black representative, first time since Reconstruction.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So when we're talking about putting White House appointees in place, it may sound kind of trivial today, but you need to understand that there has been an erasure of black presence at the federal level, especially from the South--and, and Carter brings up an army of, of southern folks into the White House. One of the slams against him is that he didn't understand D.C. In fact, he tried to play himself against D.C., and he brought in all these southern yokels--this was the critique--that didn't understand how to navigate D.C., but he brought up these traditions as well. A tradition of black erasure, but Carter changes that. He was a real progressive on that re--in that regard. But still there is controversy. Andrew Young, former civil rights activist extraordinaire, he's a United Nations ambassador, big deal, but meets with Yasser Arafat without authorization. He's forced to resign. There's this always lingering connection between African Americans and the "Jewish question" in the Middle East and Palestine.
¡¡¡¡But what really does Carter in is not sort of black advisers doing things with great independence. Basically, it's a largely ineffective presidency. The economy that had gone in the tank during the Nixon and Ford administration stays in the tank with Carter. Students in Iran capture the U.S. embassy and start hostages--keep, keep hostages, keeps them for the, the remainder of the Carter presidency--presidency. Carter actually tried to have this incredible raid, storm the embassy, and then it was destroyed by complete ineptitude in the deserts, and Carter was exposed for being just ineffective across the board. Seeing an opportunity, tried to step in and bring back America's pride. Oh one thing I forgot to mention, part of the economic challenges here is incredible oil crises. The Middle East is rising up in a coherent way that hadn't been seen before and is crippling the United States over oil.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡This is a period of incredible rationing of oil. Where, I know in Maryland, where I was living at the time with my parents, depending on your license plate number, you could get gasoline on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. That was it. And my parents would go and get gasoline at the local, local store, and they'd be gone for three hours, because the line was miles long, just to get gasoline. The country was caught in a vise grip.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 7. The Political and Social Milieu around President Ronald Reagan¡¯s Administration [00:39:42]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡And the former governor from California, Ronald Reagan, sees this as a great opportunity to finally realize his presidential goals. He runs on a campaign of trying to bring pride back to the United States, you know, embolden the American presence overseas. He has this idea about an economic, a new economic model that plenty of people are willing to try, because nothing else is working. And Reagan, with his incredible oratorical gifts, and they're really quite stunning--only Clinton and Obama can come close to Reagan's gifts, and they actually modeled themselves off Reagan's oratorical styles.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Reagan ultimately wins in a landslide, wipes out a sitting Pres--President, and he's given carte blanche to set a new agenda for the country, set a new agenda in Washington, D.C. He runs on a prob--on a, on a platform, largely saying that government is the problem, something we've all become quite familiar hearing from political conservatives, and now especially the, the fringe Tea Party, the political fringe in the Tea Party, that the federal government is the problem, and that if we could just go back to the day when the federal government wasn't so intrusive, we'd find our way out of this mess. Reagan articulates this most famously when he declares that he¡¯s--officially declares that he's running for President. Now he's running around, you know, testing out the talk in various places quietly in the country, but he makes his public declar--declaration for his candidacy in Mississippi, at the state fair. And he declares at the state fair in Philadelphia, Mississippi--I hope that rings a bell--that he's for states' rights. Again, federal government is the problem; states' rights are the solution. In Philadelphia, Mississippi.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now it's important to belabor the point, just in case, just to make sure you don't miss it. When, when Reagan does this, it shocks people as much as it excites people. Certainly his political base is thrilled. "Finally, someone who's going to get the federal government off our damn back."  Civil rights activists are horrified, for reasons I hope are painfully obvious to you at this point. I've already laid out over the course of the last few weeks this, this battle, no longer simmering, between the federal government's ability to exert authority versus the state--individual state governments. So much of the civil rights agenda of the 1960s was about creating federal oversight into elections, for instance, and to access for public accommodation, places of public conveyance. The federal government was seen by African Americans and other civil rights activists--quote, friends of the movement--the federal government is seen to be the most responsible entity to preserve citizenship rights, and Reagan says, "No, that--the government is actually the problem. Let's give power back to the states." 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now when you are going to Mississippi, or any southeastern state at that time, the civil rights--the heights of the civil rights movement are just a decade previous. When you go to these places and declare you're for states' rights, everybody knows, black as well as white, what you're talking about. You're talking about a return of the organizing, or the, the centralizing power of people like Bull Connor, people like Orville Faubus. You're talking about authorizing the economic power of citizens' councils. You're talking about supporting in covert ways the Ku Klux Klan in the worst of the situations. Now I mentioned a few moments ago that Jesse Jackson's fighting against economic policies. And this is in his speech in eighty-eight, the economic policies that Reagan puts into motion after he wins the presidency. And he's also fighting against an aura, or an era I should say, of covert racial politics. And this is where Reagan's announcement is so particularly important. Reagan never mentions anything about race when he declares for the presidency. But when you talk about states' rights in Philadelphia, Mississippi, the site where Schwerner, Goodman, and Chaney would disappeared, people understand what you're talking about.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡And this is what has happened to the--and we'll see, over the course of the next two lectures, this is what has happened to the conversation about race in America, in what is allegedly the post-civil rights moment. The laws are on the books, the Voting Rights Act--the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act. Affirmative action is there. You have all these mechanisms in place to pre--preserve citizenship that have been race-based because they've been race-denied. It is certainly not fashionable any longer, unless you're out on the political fringe, to, to race-bait in a way that you could have before. You know, Bull Connor was proven wrong. You can't be like Bull Connor and expect to have a political future. It's uncomfortable to talk about race in a way that someone might, someone might interpret as, as negative. No one wants to be seen as a po--as, as racist, certainly no one who wants to get elected to office, because if he starts being seen as a racist, well, Jesse Jackson's going to rally the troops and come after you. And I'm not really being fanciful; I'm being literal. And so you have a rise of politicians, and Reagan is an absolute expert at it, that can talk about race politics with never talking about race. And that moment, as you'll see over--again over the next two lectures, has never left and every politician since has mastered it just as well. And we'll pick up on that on Wednesday. Thank you.

¡¡¡¡Lecture 23 - Public Policy and Presidential Politics (continued) [April 14, 2010]
¡¡¡¡Chapter 1. The Political Rhetoric from the George H.W. Bush/Michael Dukkakis Campaigns [00:00:00]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Professor Jonathan Holloway: On Monday I was talking about looking at the cultural politics and the high politics of the nineteen--well, canvassing from the mid sixites, but really covering the 1970s and into the eighties through Jesse Jackson and his presidential--well, his politics, political rise and his presidential ambitions. I want to jump off from that point, from Jesse Jackson's eighty-eight campaign. I might dip a little bit back in the eighties, but mostly we're moving forward here, still focusing on the world of high politics, but, but then coming around to the connections between media and high politics, and the way in which they have this sort of bizarre embrace of one another, and I think how it's also caught in a vise. So you remember of course eighty-eighty, Jackson's presidential campaign, his second one, and he's running via the politics of the Rainbow Coalition, you know, a grand patch--a grand quilt made up of a series of patches that, at least in forms of his words--the form of his words, transcended race politics. Now Jackson, as you saw in the, in the video clip on Monday, still speaks in the grand tradition of, of the black minister. So one could, you know--some critics were saying, "Well, he speaks about a Rainbow Coalition, but he's still talking to black America in a black voice."  Now be that as it may, we can debate that till we're blue in the face, I already told you that Jackson stuns the nation by being a Democratic front runner for a short while. But in the end, of course, rhet--you know, rhetoric, rhetorical devices aside, political agenda or strategy aside, the fact is, he doesn't secure the nomination; Dukakis does.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So you go into the fall election campaign in eighty-eight with George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis--George Bush at that point appointed the Vice President of the United States--in a campaign for the presidency. And you see in this campaign a remarkable evolutionary moment, I suppose, of--You see emerge a new discourse on race. It's almost a discourse about race more than anything else. As I've already made clear, beginning really at the end of the 1960s with Nixon's presidential campaign that called for law and order, and obviousing--obvious positioning of Nixon against the activists, the peaceniks, the pinkos, the reds, the student anarchists and black revolutionaries, you see in the late sixites, in the, in the very clear ways, a subversion of racial conversations, in the sense that we can't talk about race. It's the third rail of politics. Cause if we talk about race, we're going to be damned--we're going to be associated with being, being racist, and that's a political charge that's very hard to survive.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So you see a very clear development amongst politicians of all stripes, certainly at the national level--and I'm speaking at the national level for this particular course--this, this lecture--development of racial code words that make clear politicians' agend--political agenda vis-¨¤-vis race, but never talking about race. We saw this when, with Ronald Reagan declares his candidacy, you know, the great communicator, about states' rights in Philadelphia, Mississippi. And I honestly, I was younger at the time, not paying complete attention, but I honestly don't recall Reagan saying in public any critical or racist comment that one could say is literally racist or literally racialist in this kind of critical way, even though quietly, and behind the scenes, Reagan's racial politics left much to be desired as far as black America was concerned, of course. Reagan's famous, most famous sort of racial outreach would be signing of Martin Luther King Day into a federal holiday, something he was opposed to, by the way, for a variety of reasons, he claimed. But he was opposed to it, and then it became politically clear that he needed to let it happen, and he was going to let it just sit on his desk and therefore become a law after the course of ten days, once Congress passed it. But then it became clear to his advisors, you can actually get a lot of political mileage out of signing this law--into law, in, into law. He's going to sign it in his office. They said, "You can get more political mileage out of a rose garden ceremony."  And so there you have Ronald Reagan, who is opposed to the bill from the very beginning, signing into law MLK Day as a federal holiday, an individual he referred, referred to jokingly with his advisers as "Martin Lucifer King."  Perhaps an innocent joke, perhaps something quite different.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡But that was Reagan, the great communicator. His Vice President, George Herbert Walker Bush, was not a great communicator, not in the least. He didn't have the verbal skills to sway hesitant voters, and in his case, he'd already lost to Reagan before. And he lost because Reagan was able to convince people who were, I mean, you know, moderate Democrat's that Reagan's agenda is the one that served them best. So the question is--I'm sorry to interrupt. [Looks at Student]  You've got to finish that candy bar. It's incredibly distracting. Just take it all out. Thank you. All right, cool. Now in order to appease the conservative arm of the Republican Party, the party that Bush is going to have to rely on for his base, Bush starts marching rightward. He was actually a moderate Republican. Starts marching rightward, especially against Dukakis, who is a rather progressive liberal as far as mainstream elective politics are concerned. Bush and his advisers, his campaign, campaign team, makes a big deal out of calling Dukakis a card carrying liberal, which, I mean if you think about it, actually made--it made no sense, but in the world of politics that doesn't really matter. He's a card carrying liberal, which harkens back to, you know, the, the specter of being a card-carrying Communist. So for a generation, this actually resonated in a powerful way.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡They also said--this is really the most effective point on, on Dukakis in, in terms of tarring him with a certain kind of politics--is that he was soft on crime. That's the important phrase, he's soft on crime. You have, during this moment, during the, the 1980s, this moment leading up to the Bush/Dukakis campaign, the age old links of black, especially black men to crime, are sort of further and deeply embedded into the nation's subconscious. There was a war on drugs, you know, the rhetoric, "we're going to have a war on drugs."  There was the crack ec--epidemic that was ravishing--ravaging, excuse me, ravaging so many of our nation's inner-cities. It was actually still going on in the early nineties. I lived in New Haven then and was--it had torn apart this city as well. You have gang warfare going on almost seemingly uninterrupted. These are very real things, but also popularized in our media in very fantastic ways.

¡¡¡¡You have in the mid eighties, 1984, a white man named Bernhard Goetz who's a--New York City--who's approached by four black teenagers, who later confessed that they were on the way to break into video machines for some cash, these four teenagers go up to Bernard Goetz and ask him--or panhandling and threatening, offering threatening remarks. And Goetz pulls out a thirty-eight revolver and begins firing, in the subway, in the car. He hits all four, sees two on the ground moving, approaches them, and asks if they'd had enough, and tries to shoot them again, but the revolver is empty. This is horrifying. But what's fascinating though, in a clinical sense, not to diminish this, is that Goetz is hailed as the "Subway Vigilante."  It's like, "finally, someone is standing up to the people who are taking apart--taking control of our cities." "The people."  These black men, these teenagers, these criminals; that the white--the angry white man is standing up and doing what we all want to do. Now I'm not saying everybody felt this way, but I'm saying this is the way that the press whips this up into a hysteria.

¡¡¡¡Chapter 3. The Willie Horton Advertisement [00:09:08]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So you--that's just one moment, but it is a motif for much of the 1980s, thinking about crime and race. So now when Bush's campaign decides to paint Dukakis as soft on crime, they hunted for the perfect image. This is what political campaigns do; this is what political activists do, and they found one. And they found one in the narrative and the image of Willie Horton. Excuse me, I just want to queue it up. Who's Willie Horton?  Willie Horton, African American male, criminal, in the state of Massachusetts, a violent criminal. He's given a forty-eight hour furlough, as it turns out by accident. He's given a forty-eight hour furlough as part of Massachusetts' policies about trying to help rehabilitate criminals. They can, they can therefore become functioning parts of society. He's given a forty-eight hour furlough in June of 1986 and doesn't return. He just skips out. A year later, he attacks a Maryland couple, raping the woman, flees, is caught in October of eighty-seven. He's sentenced in Maryland and by April 1988, two years, not quite two years after he was furloughed, the furlough program is over in Massachusetts. Race is never mentioned when, when, when the Bush campaign starts to talk about this history. Race is never mentioned, but this is the ad that they run. The sound will probably be a little bit high. And I'm sorry, it's, it¡¯s, it¡¯s rather pixilated. It's the best version I've, I¡¯ve been able to find, actually.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    [Narrator:]  Bush and Dukakis on crime. Bush supports the death penalty for first-degree murderers. Dukakis not only opposes the death penalty, he allowed first-degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison. One was Willie Horton, who murdered a boy in a robbery, stabbing him nineteen times. Despite a life sentence, Horton received ten weekend passes from prison. Horton fled, kidnapped a young couple, stabbing the man and repeatedly raping his girlfriend. Weekend prison passes. Dukakis on Crime.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Not very subtle. Well, the ad, if you're listening, never mentions race at all. It shows the image of Willie Horton, his mug shot. And it--and I know it's grainy in this, in this projection you saw on, in the classroom, but the image was always grainy, never really a high quality image. The ad actually only runs a few times. Activists are beside themselves. Not even just activists; you know, Dem--Democratic loyalists are horrified. They're not trying to defend Willie Horton, and they aren't actually even trying to defend the Massachusetts rehabilitation program. Al Gore, who was, who had when he was in the, the, the primary campaign, had attacked Dukakis repeatedly on this very issue, but never made an advertisement out of it. Anyway, liberals are horrified because it's quite clear that what the Bush campaign is actually trying to do is trying to connect, or reconnect, or reaffirm the notion that the black male is the person to be feared, feared; that if Dukakis is in office, that it's the black male who will, who will benefit. Now again, the ad only runs a few times. It gets incredible attention, and you've grown up in a different era, when this is actually a literal part of the campaign strategy in the twenty-four hour news cycle. The twenty-four hour news cycle was still fairly young, and the ad just gets repeated over and over again by the talking heads and news anchors. It¡¯s free advertising.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Bush himself comes out against the, the advertisement right away--well, within a day--and he says, "I've never advertised this. I denounce it. This is the worst kind of, of racial politicking."  He calls it what it was. "I want nothing to do with it."  And Bush actually had--I mean, he was a moderate Republican for a very long time--had a pretty reasonable record, at least at the interpersonal level, on race issues. Now was he a friend of the race?  I leave that to other people to make a declaration and determination about it. But he comes out against the ad. Did he know about it beforehand?  Wouldn't be surprised if he did, if it's all orchestrated, but I don't know. The fact is that Bush, that, that the campaign was speaking to the phenomenon that had become heightened during the 1980s, the special coding--coding, C-O-D-I-N-G--that linked people's awareness of race, crime and underscored the belief systems that was, crime was the special province of the black male. The code words are accompanied by an image in this case, that's figuratively saying "Watch out!  Put Dukakis in office, Willie Horton will come get you next." 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Well, Dukakis doesn't win. I'm not saying the ad is the difference, but it's one of the more notorious ads in modern political campaigning. But the--Dukakis doesn't win, so, you know, I think we're in a new era perhaps of more tough on crime approaches. But the racial hysteria that's part of tough on crime is really hard to beat down.

¡¡¡¡Chapter 4. The Carjacking of Charles Stuart [00:15:23]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡In 1989, just up the road in Boston, Carol Stuart, white woman, very pregnant, is on her way with her husband to hospital, and they are carjacked. She's shot in the head, husband's shot in the gut. He survives. Carol  Stuart doesn't. Ultimately the baby doesn't either. When Charles Stuart recovers, he claims that--he knew it was dark out, it's hard to see--but a black man with a raspy voice in a track suit did it. A huge manhunt ensues. This was a horrible crime. A huge manhunt ensues where the Boston police basically start detaining large numbers of black men who fit the description. They had a raspy voice, they owned a tracksuit. They had no visual to go on.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now, local newspapers' headlines are screaming about these racially, these racially motivated shooting. This is an era of carjackings and again gang warfare and racially motivated shootings in people's minds. Two months go by. People start--I mean, liberal progressives are upset at this dragnet being dropped down by the Boston police over black Boston. But two months go by, there's a break in the case. Charles Stuart identifies a black man as the person who pulled the gun. He's arrested. He has a long criminal record, but he has a very strong alibi, and the only evidence against this alibi is Stuart's claim. People start poking around, investigative journalists, and start wondering. And Boston police do not have a strong record--well, they had a strong record, a negative record, when it came to racial issues in the community. People start poking around, they start discovering things about Charles Stuart that don't really sound that¡ªwell, they sound strange: there¡¯s a large insurance policy taken out against his wife not long before she was murdered; allegations that Charles Stuart was, you know, drinking issues and that he might have had a girlfriend on the side; maybe he wanted a divorce, it wasn't quite clear; tensions in the marriage. January 1990 now, Stuart's car is found running on a bridge in Boston and a suicide note's found inside. It turns out he murdered his wife, he shot himself in the gut. He made up the entire story. There was that huge insurance policy. His brother, with whom he developed this plan, is the one who finally came clean and, and gave all of the back story.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Stepping away from the Stuart family themselves, they're a very tragic family, a larger question was raised about the presumption of guilt and the racial--racialization of crime, the sensationalization by the media of the linkage between race and crime in this case. Questions were raised again about police ineptitude and insensitivity or intransigence.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 5. The Central Park Jogger [00:19:08]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡While all of this is happening in the Charles Stuart case, you have down in New York City a very famous case involving the Central Park jogger case. A white woman goes jogging in Central Park at night, investment banker. She's attacked by teenage boys. The press likened it to--the boys to a "roving pack of wolves."  This is literal, a "roving pack of wolves."  There's hysterical reportage. Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty. The mayor referred to them as monsters. At the time the trial was going on, a gang of thirty Italian American boys from Ben--Bensonhurst cornered sixteen year-old Yusef Hawkins in a used car parking lot and shot him dead. Press, press referred to that gang simply as "white young men" and the mayor referred to the incident as "an enormous tragedy," as it was. But there was, there were no full-page, page ads calling for the death penalty.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡You may remember that in 2002, some thirteen years after the fact, Matias Reyes confesses to raping the young woman, and his DNA matched. Another instance of profound police ineptitude because they had the guy the whole time, essentially, and the young men who were kind of raising hell in Central Park, but they weren't rapists, many of them languished behind bars for quite some time. And it¡¯s, and I don¡¯t want to make the connection to the Scottsboro boys' case, but there are linkages all the same. This is the state of affairs. You have, in an era of racial hysteria and racial code wording--now one thing I forgot about the Central Park case, one of the phrases used that these. these young boys who are like wolves on a hunt were going wild. So "wilding" was a catchphrase for adolescent boys, Latino or African American, up to no good, that they're going wilding.

¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 6. Senator Jesse Helms¡¯ ¡°Angry Hands¡± Advertisement [00:21:08]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡1990, in the same moment when--same year that Charles Stuart comes clean--well, kills himself and then comes clean about murdering his wife--you have an unusually tense campaign developing in North Carolina. Jesse Helms, senator from North Carolina, very conservative, once a Democrat, had left the Democratic Party to become a Republican, very powerful. Jesse Helms is facing an unexpectedly strong challenge from Harvey Gantt, a black candidate, former mayor of Charlotte. Gantt is ahead of Helms through much of the campaign. As we're getting close to election day, he's clearly ahead of Helms two weeks before the election. Helms used an infusion of capital to start--of, of cash--to start running television ads. They were full of visually coded language and outright language that were essentially racist. The clip I'm about to show you is the most famous of them. Simply referred to in media circles as "Angry Hands."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    [Narrator:]  You needed that job, and you were the best qualified, but they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota. Is that really fair?  Harvey Gantt says it is. Gantt supports Ted Kennedy's racial quota law that makes the color of your skin more important than your qualifications. You vote on this issues next Tuesday. For racial quotas, Harvey Gantt. Against racial quotas, Jesse Helms.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Again, subtle?  I don't know. Well, the effect of this is really quite stunning, of this campaign wave. You have the white working-class hands holding this paper. He lost his job. You heard the--I don't need to summarize what you saw. North Carolinians go into the ballot booth, the voting booth, and they're going in talking about how they're voting for Jesse, excuse me, Harvey Gantt. It looks like Jesse Helms' day is, is now done. Helms emerges as a clear victor. I don¡¯t, I confess, I didn't put it down in my notes, but the swing is something like eight or ten percent between what he goes in as and what people come out as. And I raise the issue of, of anxiety, cultural anxiety,  "Do I, as a white North Carolinian, walk into--see a reporter who asks me who I'm going to vote for, and I say, 'Well, I'm going to vote for the black guy' because I'm racially progressive?"  But then you go in the booth, like "Oh hell no. I got--I can't do this."  Or you just lie, flat out. You know you¡¯re going to, you know you're going to vote for Helms right away, but you don't want to be seen as being somehow angry or bitter or whatever. So the "Angry Hands" ad is used, pointed to, by media experts as--it doesn't even have to be deft; It's like deft with a sledgehammer--a way of pooling together anxieties about position in society, life chances, and connecting, connecting it to race.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 7. The Rodney King Beating [00:24:52]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So the climate of race relations at the level of, of national rhetoric, essentially as I'm trying to pull together here, is just depressing. And then Rodney King decides to get behind the wheel of his car while under the range--a range of illegal, well legal and illegal, influences. On March 3rd, 1991, there's a high speed chase in Los Angeles. King refuses to get into--I'm just realizing, 1991, how we¡¯ve--things have changed. How many of you were born in 1991?  [Surveys Students]  Oh my god. Okay, sorry, it's just the passage of time. It's just rather traumatic for some of us. You'll be there too soon. Anyway, at the moment some of you were born, Rodney King jumps into a car and a high speed chase ensues. He's finally pulled over. A whole gang of police is there. King refuses to get into a prone position and seems to charge an officer. He's beaten by the police, subdued and beaten, and he's arrested; arrested, I should put on record, for every good reason. But the beating was real. He suffered a fractured skull and internal in--injuries from this beating. Now I will not ever equate Rodney King with a civil rights activist, ever. But the beating's in line of the civil rights beating--of the beatings that people like John Lewis received at the batons of the sheriffs and defuties--deputies when they tried to cross the bridge in--out of Selma, Alabama.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡And I should say for--I mean, you all were actually too young--this is actually a radical moment in the world of media and politics, because, I'm forgetting the man's name now, but, you know, the beating was captured on, on a video camera. It's the beginning of a video camera age, and really the, the start of, of reality culture, so called reality programming culture in our society. That video changed the way we understand news, and who we are, and, and what should be known and not known. Anyway, two weeks later, after the arrest, four police officers are charged with assault. There's an investigation going on, because black citizens are saying, "Look, this happens to us all the time. Yeah, this is excess, but there's a history of police brutality against blacks and Latinos in Los Angeles."  A report--a, a commission is formed; they start investigating these claims and dis--and release a report in July of that same year about widespread police brutality, and excessive force, and institutionalized race--racism within Los Angeles. Hold on to that moment, okay? 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 8. The Murder of Latasha Harlins by a Korean Shopkeeper [00:27:49]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now, March 16th, the day after the officers in the Rodney King case are charged with assault, Latasha Harlins, black teenager, gets into an argument over a, over a carton of orange juice, a dollar and seventy-nine cents, in her neighborhood. She's in a local store. This is in South Central Los Angeles, more famously coded as Watts, which I'll be talking about later on, but that coding--store that after the, the riots in 1965--I mean, a, a neighborhood that the riots after sixty-five, where the stores were, were burned out. Koreans, Koreans came in in force and started occupying a lot of the stores, and so they were one of the major business forces in this part of the city. A history of great tension between African American and Latino citizens in this part of the city, and the Korean store owners. Latasha Harlins goes in and buys--and, and goes to get some orange juice and there's a dispute over whether she paid, whether she didn't pay, whether she's trying to take something. The shopkeeper, Soon Ja Du, after there's an ex--there¡¯s a camera captured--after an exchange of heated words and some pushing and pulling, Latasha Harlins turns to go. Soon Ja Du reaches out behind the bullet proof screen--the place had been robbed several times--pulls out a pistol and shoots Latasha Harlins in the head, kills her. All captured on the store camera.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡That fall, Soon Ja Du is sentenced for murdering Latasha Harlins, and her sentence, six months of community service. Black community is astonished. How could this be possible?  Whether Latasha Harlins even hit--whether she hit Soon Ja Du or not, whether she was trying to steal the car--carton of orange juice or not, how can you only give six months of community service for shooting somebody in the back--for shooting somebody, but in the back of the head from point blank range?  But that was the sentence. You take this racial tension. You take the police report--the commission report of police brutality, you add these things together, and take yourself to April 1992 when all four police officers who were charged with assault are cleared of their charges. Los Angeles erupts. Fifty-four people die over the course of several days of rioting. There's looting, attacks against whites and Asians, against property. Thousands are injured, twelve thousand are arrested. More than one billion dollars of property damage, destruction covering an area larger, I think, I think larger than San Francisco, if I remember one little factoid correctly. During the riots, an inarticulate King is brought before the camera, trying to appeal for peace, and stuttering through the phrase, "Can't we all just get along?" 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡There's another important current to know about this story is that there is, in thinking about the connections of, connections between media and politics--I learned a lot about the media during this particular riot. I was actually in what is now Au Bon Pain, which used to be a family sort of bar here. And I was studying--I was pursuing my Ph.D. here in history, having moved from L.A. a couple of years ago. I'd heard from some friends that the officers had been acquitted, and I walk into this restaurant, and, you know, there's TVs up around. We're at this bar-restaurant, and everybody's looking up. You look up, look up at the TV set, and you start seeing--and the sound is off, but you see the scroll going across the bottom of the screen. You're seeing all of these images, and there¡¯s talking about African Americans rioting in South Central, summing up collectively what the scroll is doing. And I'm watching from the perspective of the, the camera in the helicopter, and I'm realizing that what I'm seeing is actually not black people but brown people. And then what I'm also seeing is the intersection about four blocks from where I lived in Los Angeles three years earlier.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Anybody here from L.A. or knows L.A.?  One or two lonely hands. Well, welcome east. The--South Central is an area south of downtown Los Angeles, south of the freeway, the ten. I lived north of the ten and west of Los Angeles on the northern edge of Koreatown, which was populated by Nicaraguans and El Salvadorians at that time. The camera was floating above the intersection near where I lived, but it was coded as South Central Los Angeles. The place was wrong, the people were wrong, but the narrative that people are seeing, as they're watching this image, all silent, is black people are rioting in South Central. It's a moment in which you see a racial codification, codification, a national racial script of "blacks are criminals" and Watts, having been, you know, burned into our minds through a lot of the cultural politics in the 1980s, with the, with gangs going crazy, the Cripps and the Bloods. It's a "Watts phenomenon," that this is where it's happening all over again. The fact is, the riot was happening everywhere.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Another moment of media representation of race, far more famous than my, my--actually, my moment's not famous at all. I just happened to have witnessed it--revolves around the individual¡ªthe, the, the history of Reginald Denny. A white guy hears that his friends are in trouble, caught near the vortex of the riot. He's going to go help them. He's a truck driver. His truck is stopped, and some thugs pull him out, and they start beating him, taking a brick, try--I mean, trying to kill the guy. Black guys attacking the white truck driver, the true innocent, and he was a true innocent, and the blacks were nothing but criminals in this case. Cameras focusing, watching this thing happen. People are transfixed and horrified. Denny survives, he does survive, but the phenomenon of black kids beating up on an innocent white person is what the, the script read. What the script didn't read is the fact that the people who saved Denny were some older blacks who saw this happening on T.V., knew the intersection, got in the car, ran over to him, saved him, got him in the car, took him to the hospital. The script also didn't read the fact that Denny was telling people afterwards, you know, "Quit using me as a political football. I don't want to be used in this way. Stop it."  But he had lost control over his own virtual projected image. So you have in the wake of¡ªI mean, there's many different narratives to tell you about the L.A. uprising, L.A. riots. I want to use it for the, the coming together in the most gruesome way of the racialization of crime and also the media representations of race during the late eighties and early nineties.

¡¡¡¡Chapter 9. The Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill Controversy [00:35:25]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡We have come to the place by the early nineties where it¡¯s become too easy, where it had become too easy for people to play the race card, like in the Reginald Denny case, like in, I mean, any number of cases I've already cited in the course of this lecture. You see the race card played to perfection though in the greatest theater of high politics. I'm not talking campaigns. That's the gutter of high politics, often. In the grandest theater of politics, high politics, is that revolving around a Supreme Court nomination. Nineteen ninety-one, in the midst of all this stuff I've been talking about, Thurgood Marshall, exhausted for years, finally says, "I can't wait for a Democrat to take office. I'm retiring."  He retires, and on July 1st, George Bush nominates Clarence Thomas to succeed Marshall on the Supreme Court. Clarence Thomas, a onetime black nationalist, you know, he was a law school, law school student here. He was known for wearing his fatigues and talking about Malcolm X as the person who had it all figured out, but is someone who turned into an anti-affirmative action activist, anti-welfare as well, anti-abortion rights. And he can have these ideas. Those ideas are fine to have as a Supreme Court nominee.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Bush declares he's the most nominated person he could find. He did a great search, and something that drew gasps from many lawyers, many regarding other politics. Thomas had barely been on the bench. He'd been a legislative staffer, then had become, under Ronald Reagan, the head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He had just, just been elevated to the bench. The NAACP, the National Urban League, the National Bar Association, which is, quote, the "black" National Law Association, all oppose Thomas's nomination. The American Bar Association refuses to consider him, quote, "well qualified," which is one of their, their rankings. But a smooth nomination process ensues. They know it's going to be a split vote, and, ultimately, when it¡¯s in committee--I've skipped--when it's in committee, it doesn't send out a full--a recommendation to the full Senate, but they know it's going to go smoothly, it seems. And then the Anita Hill allegation finally gets heard. Anita Hill, who had been assistant to Clarence Thomas when he was at the EEOC, had made allegations already, and people weren't paying attention to it, about Thomas's inappropriate behavior in a work environment. And I'll quote from part of her testimony:
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    "My working relationship became even more strained when Judge Thomas began to use work situations to discuss sex. On these occasions, he would call me into his office for reports on education issues and projects, or he might suggest that, because of time pressures, we go to a lunch at a government cafeteria. After a brief discussion of work, he would turn the conversation to discussions of sexual matters. His conversations were very vivid. He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts. On several occasions, Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess. Because I was extremely uncomfortable talking about sex with him at all and particularly in such a graphic way, I told him that I did not want to talk about these subjects. I would also try to change the subject to education matters or to nonsexual personal matters such as his background or his beliefs. My efforts to change the subject were rarely successful."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Skipping ahead in the same testimony:
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    One of the oddest episodes I remember was an occasion in which Thomas was drinking a Coke in his office. He got up from the table at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the Coke, looked at the can and said, "Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?" On other occasions, he referred to the size of his own penis as being larger than normal, and he also spoke on some occasions of the pleasures he had given to women with oral sex."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡<<computer beeps>> Nothing related to the testimony. [Students laugh] I've got an appointment to go to after class is over. [More laughter] A business appointment to go to after class is over. [More laughter] Raise the level, everybody, raise the level. Thomas denies these allegations, and this of course, you know, fascinates the press to no end and, in a clever yet cynical turn, silences all debate on the topic. And I read here from his rebuttal:
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    "I have complied with the rules. I responded to a document request that produced over thirty thousand pages of documents. And I have testified for five full days under oath. I have endured this ordeal for a hundred and three days. Reporters sneaking into my garage to examine books I read. Reporters and interest groups swarming over divorce papers, looking for dirt. Unnamed people starting preposterous and damaging rumors. Calls all over the country specifically requesting dirt. This is not American. This is Kafka-esque. It has got to stop. It must stop for the benefit of future nominees and our country. Enough is enough. I am not going to allow myself to be further humiliated in order to be confirmed. I am here specifically to respond to allegations of sex harassment in the workplace. I am not here to be further humiliated by this committee or anyone else, or to put my private life on display for a prurient interest or other reasons. I will not allow this committee or anyone else to probe into my private life. This is not what America is all about.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    To ask me to do what I would be--to ask me to do that would be to ask me to go beyond fundamental fairness. Yesterday I called my mother. She was confined to her bed, unable to work and unable to stop crying. Enough is enough. Mr. Chairman, in my forty-three years on this Earth, I have been able, with the help of others and with the help of God, to defy poverty, avoid prison, overcome segregation, bigotry, racism, and obtain one of the finest educations available in this country. But I have not been able to overcome this process. This is worse than any obstacle or anything that I have ever faced. Throughout my life I have been energized by the expectation and the hope that in this country I would be treated fairly in all endeavors. When there was segregation, I hoped that there would be fairness one day or some day. When there was bigotry and prejudice, I hoped that there would be tolerance and understanding some day.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    Mr. Chairman, I am proud of my life, and what I have done, and what I have accomplished, proud of my family, and this process, this process is trying to destroy it all. No job is worth what I have been through, no job. No horror in my life has been so debilitating. Confirm me if you want, don't confirm me if you are so led, but let this process end. Let me and my family regain our lives. I never asked to be nominated. It was an honor. Little did I know the price, but it is too high.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    Mr. Chairman, (later on in the excerpt) I am a victim of this process and my name has been harmed, my integrity has been harmed, my character has been harmed, my family has been harmed, my friends have been harmed. There is nothing this committee, this body, or this country can do to give me my good name back, nothing. I will not provide the rope for my own lynching, for further humiliation. I am not going to engage in discussions, nor will I submit to roving questions of what goes on in the most intimate parts of my private life or the sanctity of my bedroom. These are the most intimate parts of my privacy, and they will remain that--they will remain just that, private."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡When he read this testimony, he referred to it--his anger, his jaws are clenched--said "this is nothing but a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who deign to think for themselves."  When Thomas does this, it is actually politically incredibly brilliant. Cynical no doubt, but incredibly brilliant. This is a person throughout his testimony, or the nomination process, that made it clear that he was opposed to racial set aside politics, affirmative action, even though he had benefited from it. He was opposed to the kind of racial thinking that had so much of all of us sort of trapped in ways that everybody understood in the early 1990s. He believed in a colorblind society, but at the moment of being caught in this web, and I cannot imagine what Thomas must have gone through--whether he deserved it or not, that's up to your personal opinion--but it had to be miserable--that at the moment of his greatest misery, he turns around and kills the process by saying, "If you continue to do what you're doing, you are essentially acting like a lynch mob in our electronic age."  The Senate panel judiciary, judiciary committee, they can't say anything at all, those who were opposed to his nomination. He freezes the conversation. It moves on and, ultimately, he's confirmed fifty-two to forty-eight in October of ninety-one.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡It's a bell weather for racial politics in post-civil rights United States, and it actually may be even more important, if you look back historically, for the way that it changed conversations about gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment claims double in the wake of the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill imbroglio. The number of women in office--who run for office and who win seats shoot up dramatically. In 1992, Time would say at the end of the year, "This is the year of the woman."  Now was it all related to Clarence Thomas. and his can of Coke. and Anita Hill's reluctant testimony?  I'm not going to claim all of that, but you need to understand, this is one of the radical shifts happening in the wake of, or as a. a sideshow of this three-ring circus of what was Clarence Thomas's nomination hearing. And it's also sort of the three-ring circus of tragedy, of racial politics and covert racial politics in the 1990s. We'll pick up on that happy note on Monday. Thank you.
¡¡¡¡Lecture 24 - Who Speaks for the Race? [April 19, 2010]
¡¡¡¡Chapter 1. Bill Clinton and Lani Guinier [00:00:00]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Professor Jonathan Holloway: Last week we spent a lot of time dealing with high electoral politics, canvassing the career of Jesse Jackson, scooting past Ronald Reagan's and George Bush's and--presidencies and the campaign, the Bush-Dukakis campaign, for, you know, the Willie Horton ad and the way, and the way in which racial conversations become subverted into something else, although still remaining quite racial in the context of 1990s politics, and something, a process that began decades earlier, certainly, with the civil rights successes or excesses, depending on one's politics. Much of last week's themes were dealing with the submergence of racial discourse and also the racialization of crime, and also the further development of coalition politics as we move to a much more racially and ethnically, ethnically mixed society. Now in the last two lectures of the course--I can't believe we're already here, but we are--I want to continue with my focus on post-civil rights presidencies and public policies, examining in particular how race affected public policy and how cultural symbols still do so many, so much heavy lifting for a much more complicated real world in which we all live. Some of the themes of this week are deal--are, are discussions relating to the presumptions of the permanence of civil rights changes, and the presumptions of the goals of civil rights. You know, what is the underlying presumption of integration?  What is the race and who speaks for the race?  These are themes you're going to pick up in your reading, certainly. There will be, as you¡¯ve become accustomed already in this course, overlapping as far as chronology as well as policy, court cases, and cultural symbols, all operating at the same time in overlapping ways.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So we left off really in George Bush's presidency. I want to pick up in 1992 with Bill Clinton being elected to the office. He's elected with a, a--embodying great Democratic promise. I mean, this is after twelve years of Republicans in control of the White House and, you know, a generation of, of younger people not ever knowing a Democrat in the White House. Bill Clinton comes in with an incredible sense of charisma, and it's really, it¡¯s really quite astonishing, and a clear natural talent to speak to black Americans in a voice that black Americans can recognize. And for African America, it becomes a moment of great hope in terms of what the potential--the future might hold. Clinton makes a lot of noise, and it turns out to be noise in many ways, about his commitment to making a cabinet and a White House administration that, quote, "looked like America."  This is one of his phrases during the period. Making his administration look like America runs into a problem, when he nominates to the position of Assistant Secretary of Civil Rights Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania at the time named Lani Guinier.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡During this moment in the early years of the Clinton presidency, or when he was President-elect, being a friend of Bill, an FOB, was a big deal. If you were a friend of Bill with all of his connections and his wife's connections, you might have a real in to becoming part of the White House administration. Lani, Lani Guinier is one of these individuals, goes, you know, goes back to law school days with the Clintons. Guinier had been an advocate for years in, in law review articles of something called cumulative voting, a process that allowed for greater interest group representation. Something along the lines, and I'm being very crude about it, if there are ten candidates running for an office, you don't just get one vote under cumulative voting. You have ten votes you spread along the ten candidates. Maybe on a certain issue, Candidate A really represents your views. You want to give that person five votes. And on a certain issue Candidate--I don't know if I did A or B or one or two--another candidate represents a lot of your opinions, so you want to give that person three votes. It's actually a way of hyper-democratizing who gets represent--represented in office. It's a process, moreover, and this is important, that the Reagan and Bush Justice Departments had sanctioned in over three dozen instances. So it is--it was an embrace of democracy, letting the little person have a, a chance to say something, and it was a process that had been embraced by Republican-nominated or controlled Department of Justice.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡However, Bill Clinton, as much as he excited the Democratic, liberal base, he infuriated a conservative base, and that conservative base went into attack mode. There'd been a phrase that had been really popularized during Ronald Reagan's presidency, and that's this the phrase, the spin doctor. Someone who comes in, who doctors up the message, spins it around, and turns it into something quite different. Lani Guinier is tagged, because of her cumulative voting ideology, as being a "quota queen" by conservative media types. She's a "quota queen."  Now what's the big deal with the phrase?  The phrase actually is very clever, because it links to two different problems in the American present to the American past. One is this direct connotation of the welfare queen, which is a, an, a catchphrase of the eighties. Welfare queens were used as individuals, I mean propped up as individuals who were bringing down the American social network and really a blight on the American economy. And these were depicted as women, of course, they were queens, overwhelmingly African American, although most welfare recipients are not African American, but people who, who capitalized upon the system and took advantage of it; that under the logic of welfare at the time, the more children you had, the more aid you received. Now the story's much more complicated than this, but the, the construction of the image was that the welfare queen was the person responsible for being a real drain on the system.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So Guinier's politics or ideology is linked to excess, excess of the state with the welfare queen ideology. But the quota part¡¯s also important. That links back earlier than the Reagan presidency, by linking it to quotas, something that had come up in the Supreme Court case in Bakke versus the Regents of the University of California, decided in 1978. The Supreme Court case had said that quotas were unconstitutional. Now Bakke, just in a super quick nutshell, Allan Bakke, white man, sues--applies for University of California, Davis medical school, isn't admitted. And he discovers through his research that according to scores, in terms of what scores people received on the MCAT, that African American/Latino applicants got in who scored lower than he did. And then he also discovered that UC Davis, in an attempt to diversify its student body, had created a set aside program that had quotas, that--and I'm making the numbers up here--that "we¡¯re going to admit up to twenty, or at minimum twenty"--again, I don¡¯t--the, the actual terminology is not important right now--"African American/Latino medical students into UC Davis, with a goal of diversifying our population." 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡The Supreme Court weighs in in 1978 saying that such set aside programs, mandated numbers, were unconstitutional. [Looks at screen] Okay, there it is. I had mute on, I¡¯m sorry. That you cannot just pick a number and say that that's okay. So Guinier is linked to the excesses of welfare reform or welfare policies in the 1980s, the excesses of civil rights ideology, trying to diversify America through quotas, through the 1970s, decided in seventy-eight. And people started attacking her, politicians, activists. Clinton famously takes her--says he's going to take a retreat to Camp David and takes her, her law review articles. He's going to think about it. And he comes back from Camp David saying, you know, "I've looked at this thing more carefully, and, you know, her views are not in line with the kind of politics that I want to practice."  And Clinton withdraws the nomination, even when his attorney general, Janet Reno, said that Guinier deserved the right to at least present her actual views. The views had been misappropriated. Black liberals felt cheated by Clinton as he made a clear move to the center. They felt he was caving in to conservative politicians and activists. And whether he was or he wasn't, Clinton does--I mean on that case with Lani Guinier, Clinton does make a very clear move to take up Reagan's strategy of capture--Reagan captured the, the moderate Democrat who was fed up and frustrated, and brought them over to the Republican camp; Clinton went to take them back. He wanted to capture the middle ground voters in America, which, as the politics in this country become more conservative, meant a dramatic turn or a shift to the right.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now in part, liberals are concerned because they see Clinton's decision as part of a general move away from substantive embrace of civil rights ideologies and victories of the late 1960s--of the 1960s. Clinton, it soon seemed to these liberals and activists, was more willing, more than willing, to cede ground to conservatives in order to steal some of their thunder. In fact, you, you¡¯d hear activists during the 1990s being frustrated, because Clinton was saying all these things, "all these things" in quotes, that Republicans had been talking about for the longest time, but claiming credit for them. It was a massive stroke of, of political leadership, even though it certainly frustrated to no end conservatives and liberals. Now Clinton, although an individual who had his weaknesses, he certainly had incredible strengths, and he understood the ability--he had the ability to read the tenor of the times. It's an era of repositioning on the national scene against the so called excesses of the 1960s.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 2. The Passage of Propositions 187 and 209 [00:11:39]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡In this course, I spend a lot of time talking about look--taking a critical eye, looking at southern states and their, their policies, states' versus federal rights, for example. And while other states still have, or still are quite rich with complications in terms of racial politics, I want to turn my attention for, for a little bit to the West. This is actually a, a structural flaw in the course, because there's so much material focusing on the Southeast. This is a national problem. For the moment, we'll just focus on the West. It's in California in the 1990s--It's in California in the 1990s where America sees a new frontier in race politics, and this is something that grabs the attention of the nation. I mean, California does take up a lot of space. It grabs the attention of the nation and also ends up writing a cru--a, a, an interesting chapter in Clinton's race politics. I want to talk now about propos--two propositions in the 1990s. One is Proposition 187, called "Save our State," and the second is Proposition 209, called the "California Civil Rights Initiative." 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡In 1994--and by the way, I'm sorry. For those who don't know, California has this allegedly super democratic process of changing, changing the state constitution, that if the citizens of the state garner enough signatures, and they float a proposition to change the state constitution, they can act with--they can enact changes to the constitution. Now it seems democratic on its surf--on its face, but it's actually been hijacked--I don't know when that started, probably from the beginning--by very strong corporate interest and political activist interest on all sides of the political spectrum, that have the resources to hire people to gather signatures. Proposition 187 certainly embodied this kind of organizing logic. Again, it's called "Save our State."  It's a proposition heavily supported by then Governor of California Pete Wilson, someone who'd been a moderate Republican, who turns aggressively conservative as he be--begins to put out--to cast an eye on a presidential campaign, a campaign that ultimately flops miserably. Everybody knows that race and economic issues are politically divisive, and that way they can be extremely effective. This is what Wilson identifies in Prop 187 and sees it as a way to put his name on the national screen.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Proposition 187 focused on social services. One eighty-seven ended--if, if it were put--made law, would end public social services, would end health services and education for undoc--undocumented immigrants, illegal aliens, illegal aliens. So it's ending the social network--the safety net, excuse me, and education for undocumented immigrants. And it was about addressing a fiscal crisis in healthcare in the state. It was a very real crisis, but it was also cast in racial light. There was a controversial ad that showed nighttime border crossers. Now they're non-racialized. No one ever mentions their race, the advertiser doesn't, but everybody knows that these are Mexicans crossing the border at night. And these unnamed, un-raced individuals are depicted in the ad as a pestilent scourge, scourge, like rats invading the house; that they are coming into our state, they are invading it, they're taking it over. One eighty-seven does pass. "Let's save our state, by god," but it's caught up in litigation and ultimately killed when the moderate Democrat Grey Davis now the become--now the governor of California, dismisses it in 1999. But it takes up, you know, the second half of the, the decade as far as political energy in the state of California.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡At the same time, Prop 187 is winding its way through the litigation process, California starts debating another proposition, this one in two--in 1996, Prop 209, the "California Civil Rights Initiative."  Now the "California Civil Rights Initiative" ends discrimination against and preferential treatment for any individual or groups based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. So it ends discrimination against individuals or groups, based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. This is, you know, something very much in the tradition of the civil rights heritage, of course. But it also kills preferential treatment for the same groups. It is an anti-affirmative action proposition. As Prop 209 is garnering its votes, you have, in the University of California system, a series of faculty senate votes, you know, for or against the proposition, and a, and a state prop--a state law that's being changed that's going to end affirmative action in the UC system, regardless of what California, excuse me, what Prop 209 does.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Affirmative action¡¯s killed in the UC system. The numbers of minorities plummet overnight in the flagship schools, like UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego. I was teaching at UC San Diego at the time, which did--never did have a large African American population, student population. It's around two and a half percent. Within one year, it's cut in half to one and a half percent. You have at UCLA and, and Cal tremendous drops in numbers of African American students in, in the college and also in places like the law school. Now what's really important about the "California Civil Rights Initiative" and the anti-affirmative action initiatives in the state is that--well, a couple of different things. There¡¯s a hyper-focus on race. People are talking about, you know, affirmative action and "it's going to eliminate the black and brown presence on campuses. It's going to eliminate the chance for black and brown people to, to have an equal opportunity to get certain jobs."  But the group that it affected the most was white women. Since affirmative action became a federal policy, white women have overwhelmingly been the group that benefited the most from affirmative action policies, and they would be the group most negatively affected. And yet that discourse is written out of the conversation in California.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Also, at the same time, there's a T.V. ad appears. It runs for one day, just like the Willie Horton ad, ad runs just a couple of times in a day. The T.V. ad runs for one day that claims that Martin Luther King would have supported Proposition 209, taking a few lines from his famous speeches and misrepresenting them. In fact, King had gone on the record saying that he was in support of these minority set aside programs then, soon to be called affirmative action programs. Jesse Jackson is horrified that these two professors at Berkley, I believe, who organized this ad campaign were the ones behind the logic of the "California Civil Rights Initiative," that they would misappropriate King in that way. They weren't the first, and they wouldn't be the last, but it's an important sort of legacy, or wrestling with the memory of who people like King were.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Then you have the issue of the name itself. It's the "California Civil Rights Initiative."  In our post-civil rights age, when we are all enlightened on racial issues, so our general feeling goes, who's going to be against civil rights?  People don't want to be against civil rights. They don't want to be considered racist, after all. And so when people go into the ballot booth, the election booth, and vote, it turns out Calif--Proposition 209, the "California Civ--Civil Rights Initiative," essentially sails through, and it enjoys a majority of African American support, enjoys a major--majority of support from white women, and I believe--I¡¯m just, I don't have my notes on this issue in front of me, so I'm not going to vouch for it for certain, but I think it receives a majority of Mexican American support as well. If not a majority, the numbers are high. When asked about these issues, white women responded that they didn't realize that the civ--civil rights initiative would actually--was a vote against their own self-interest. African Americans made it clear, "We're for civil rights."  They hadn't read the proposition. And Mexican Americans supported it as well for curious reasons. They support civil rights, but they also saw this way of, of supporting this platform as a way to "Americanize" themselves, even though they already had American citizenship status.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So what--taking all of these things together, what does it actually lead us to?  It leads us to a point where we are today, frankly, of a general dumbing down of discourse in politics and media about race, and a gen--general laziness as well amongst the electorate when it comes to thinking about these things. Now it doesn't help this process when you have people making editorial decisions that play to our low--lowest common denominator. And this really is a theme of the American political thought, social and cultural thought, of the last twenty or thirty years, lowest common denominator does a really great job of appearing first. So it doesn't help us become more astute thinkers about race and citizenship and belonging in politics when you have people making editorial decisions that capitalize upon racialized notions of blacks as criminal, for instance. Just, just take this--this is all the attention that I'm going to pay to the O.J. Simpson case, although it captivates the United  States.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡The picture you see on your left is the picture that ran in Time magazine of O.J. Simpson. The actual picture is the one on the right. Now people know what O.J. Simpson looks like, okay, and this is not a poor--I mean, it's, it¡¯s, it¡¯s not a high-quality image, but it's not appearing darker because it's being projected. That is a darkened, clearly darkened, picture of O.J. Simpson. So when the cover ran, people were like, "That seems a little--I don't think O.J.'s that dark."  And then someone got a hold of the actual print from the mug shot. People were up in arms. "What are you doing?"  The response was, "Well, by Photoshopping things a little bit, it made the image pop."  That was the quote, "it made the image pop."  It was a better image. As if anybody needed to have a better image of O.J. Simpson. It wasn't like he was a mystery,  And no matter what you felt about what he did or didn't do, you're still going to buy the magazine cover whether you're going to have a light image or a dark image of O.J. Simpson. The young editor, photographic editor, wasn't around much longer, I believe, at Time, but he was probably taking the fall for some other editorial decision.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Anyway, our national discourse is one that's become increasingly impoverished, and we're still in that moment in our leisurely "post-racial" today. But it's in this state of affairs, getting back to Clinton now, with Proposition "Save our State," Proposition "California Civil Rights Initiative," O.J. Simpson in that bizarre moment, it's in this state of affairs that Bill Clinton travels to University of California, San Diego for its graduation ceremony in 1997, and while there, announces a new presidential initiative, "a National Dialog on Race," or "the One America," or "the President's Race Initiative," or "a National Conversation on Race."  It had all these different titles. It was all the same thing. Clinton wanted to do something really--many of us thought that was really astonishing. Recognizing that there was an impoverished state of affair in our national conversation about race--this is a person who grows up in the South, grows up around African Americans, can speak in a vernacular diction that was reminiscent, or sounded familiar to African Americans. This is a person who got black America and was tremendously popular amongst black Americans, even despite Lani Guinier and other missteps along the way. People thought, "Wow, Clinton's actually going to do something here."  He is better positioned than any other President since Jimmy Carter to do this. The idea is, we're going to have town hall meetings all across the country where members of Clinton's Blue Ribbon Committee, chaired by the late historian John Hope Franklin, path breaking historian of many--for many reasons but, most famously, for breaking so many color lines as a black historian.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now you had these town hall meetings across the country to talk about our current conversation about race. A lot of really smart people on this committee; it seemed like a moment of real promise. And the moment kind of implodes right away when the commission comes together to sort of organize itself and Angela Oh, a Korean attorney in Los Angeles, tremendously strong record when it comes to civil rights law, she clashes immediately with John Hope Franklin. She has an incredibly strong record on civil rights activism and scholarship, and the clash was about how, in 1997/98, should America talk about race?  Franklin was saying, "You must start with slavery. Everything comes from that, that everything--every kind of conversation comes with that."  Angela Oh says, "You start from slavery, you are eliminating from the conversation millions, Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans and people from other different parts of the world who don't have part of that experience."  And in so many ways, they're both exactly right, so how do you resolve this?  Well, it turns out you don't. The commission effectively becomes a, a dead letter, had a few conversations. Nothing much comes of it. Clinton's philandering, his denial, and his impeachment, serves as a profound distraction and sinks his second term. So the conversation becomes a muted conversation, muted by the impeachment trial if nothing else. Clinton's impeachment trial was not the only important court case of the nineties. And I want to spend what time I have left talking about some of these court cases, because it brings us really--it brings us to a campus. It brings us to our fairly current moment.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 3. Shaw v. Reno [00:28:24]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡I want to talk about four court cases, three from the 1990s and one from 2003. Most of them are Supreme Court cases, not all of them though. The first one is Shaw v. Reno, v. Reno, against the attorney general of the United States, Janet Reno, and it involved redistricting in North Carolina, congressional districts. The federal government required North Carolina, the state, the legislature, to create another district that would guarantee a black majority. North Carolina's not an unusual southern state with large black populations, but also clustered black populations. And it wasn't unusual among southern states in that districts were set up in such a way that the black vote was, was watered down, thinned out. The federal government, the federal government said, "North Carolina, you need to get your act together. You need to create another district that will have--create the chance to elect a black person in office--put a black person in office. We need a black majority district."  It would be the new twelfth district in North Carolina. The district was formed, and then a suit was brought by those who felt the district was a result of racial gerrymandering. Racial gerrymandering, in this case, in support of an African American political presence. Racial gerrymandering had always been trying to eliminate a black political presence, in talking about black-white issues.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now there are several key issues that come up in the decision in Shaw v. Reno. It was decided in 1993. One key issue is that race is now a suspect category. You know, there was a slide a, a little while ago, I, I, I realized I, I left it a little bit too early in, in Bakke. Actually, let me just [adjusts slides]--one point I forgot to mention that's very important right now: quotas cannot be considered in application, but race can be considered as one of the key factors in admissions. So Bakke's point, the thing Bakke does, he says, "We can think about race when it comes to sort of adjudicating the limits, the parameters of racial belonging."  Alright, just keep that fact in mind. In Shaw v. Reno, the Supreme Court says race is a suspect category. "We've come a long way since the challenges of the 1960s and we need to think a little more carefully about when race is used."  The Voting Rights Act says that people had to consider issues of race when setting up jurisdictions, and Shaw says you just can't. So Shaw starts to chip away at the Voting Rights Act. And it comes up with a resolution: that race cannot be the predominant factor in deciding something like voting districts, but it can be considered.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So this is something in line with Bakke but a little bit different. Race can be considered but can't be the predominant factor; it is a suspect category. And this is the most important phrase. There must be a compelling government interest to justify considering race. So Shaw v. Reno is really asking, "How do we, how do we take race into consideration when we're setting up public policy?"  It challenges the Voting Rights Act of sixty-five, so it's chipping away at part of it. There must be a compelling government interest. Now this is the twelfth district, I'm going to show you in a second. And I'll confess, I remember there was a, there was a recent resolution on this last year about--it, it came back again, I confess I don't even recall what the decision was, but in ninety-three this is what people were fighting against, the twelfth district. See it right there, that little thing?  Certainly a suspect shape. I mean, districts are always weird looking anyway, following rivers or sort of, census tracts. District Twelve, and it's actually thicker here on the map than it is in reality, in the proposal, because sometimes it just ran along the highway. There's no people living on the highway. So it would go from one black neighborhood to another black neighborhood. Now the supposition of course is that black folks will vote for black people. And that's, that¡¯s something you can talk about in your discussion section. That's a whole other kind of thorny briar patch of presumptions. So North Carolina's proposed twelfth congressional district, it certainly looks awfully strange.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 4. Adarand v. Pe?a and Hopwood v. Texas [00:33:39]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Going forward, 1995, Adarand v. Pe?a. It's a case in Colorado. Adarand Construction versus Pe?a, who¡¯s the secretary of agri--transportation, excuse me. Up to this point, federal agencies had given financial incentives to those contractors who hire minority controlled subcontractors. So if you want to build something, and you're a, say a contractor, I get a bonus if I start looking for minority owned firms to help do some of the work that I'm supporting. And in this particular case, Adarand, a white-owned construction firm, submitted the lowest bid on a contract for a highway, but not, but did not get the contract. The contract went instead to a minority-owned firm. So the Supreme Court holds, the Supreme Court holds that race can only be used if there's a compelling interest, that builds off of Shaw v. Reno, and then that the government agency using racial distribution must do so under strict scrutiny, another one of these great Supreme Court phrases, and it must be used in a narrowly tailored way. Compelling interest, strict scrutiny, narrowly tailored. What you have in Adarand v. Pe?a is again a narrowing of the option to use race. You got a incred--you have to have an incredibly strong case if you're going to press a, quote, "racial iss--issue," and hope to have it succeed.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Nineteen ninety-six, state of Texas, it's not a Supreme Court case. In Hopwood v. Texas, the University of Texas law school had been aiming, a tradition of aiming to admit a class that looked like Texas. And it actually changed its admission formula to benefit black and Latino applicants. Cheryl Hopwood, the plaintiff, is one of four people, all white, who were denied admission and then sued. The district court sides with the University of Texas, saying they can set their own admissions policy. They haven't offended the logic that was announced in Bakke. The appeals court took the plaintiffs' side and in Hopwood, it says race cannot be used as a plus factor in the consideration of applications. So Texas didn't use quotas. That's unconstitutional, can't do it. But it did say--you know, I'm making up the numbers in the schematic--if one hundred points is what you need to get admitted to the University of Texas law school, if you're African American, we're going to give you ten more points. It helps boost your score. And this is actually a practice used by many universities across the country. I know it's u--used, used by the University of California--they gave a bump up to those from historically underrepresented groups. It also gave a bump up for veterans, and it gave a bump up for other, other populations as well. But it was racial and ethnic minorities who become the focus of this excess.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 5. Grutter v. Bollinger [00:37:22]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So if you take Bakke as the foundation, you add Shaw v. Reno, you take Adarand versus Pe?a, you take Hopwood versus Texas, you have a situation where the very premise of Bakke, which eliminated quotas but said race could be used, so it supported affirmative action, the premise of Bakke is being stripped away. The Voting Rights Act is being narrowed in terms of how it can be applied, and now sort of ground zero for the debate is university admissions policies. This is why the stakes were so high in 2003 at the University of Michigan. In 1997, in 1997, Barbara Grutter had applied to the University of Michigan law school and been denied admission. The law school freely admitted that it used race in its admission as a "compelling interest" to achieve diversity. It used that word that they knew was--I mean, it¡¯s law school. Compelling interest is actually--that would survive a litmus test, so they felt. But the question was, does the University of Michigan law school, did its use of preferences in student admissions violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Civil Rights Act of sixty-four?  These were the questions before the court. Now I said 1997. This thing is bouncing around until the court decides it in 2003.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡The lead up to the Supreme Court decision was really quite fascinating, because it tells a story of our contemporary political and capital--corporate culture as it, as it comes to affirmative action. You have friends of the court, petitions being filed by a whole bunch of people, and you have a really fascinating coalition being formed by corporate interests and retired military generals, that if one takes a stereotype in mind, they think, "well these are very conservative populations."  These are the groups that were very much in favor of University of Michigan's admissions policy, very much in favor of affirmative action, the military actually being one of the great places for diversifying management structures. I'm not saying it's perfect; no place is. But the military had done more than many other institutions to diversify itself over the course of the previous forty years. And corporations recognizing, if you go back to Jesse Jackson, and his Operation PUSH, and his boycotts of companies like Coca-Cola and Anheuser-Busch, corporations recognizing, "We need to have a pool of talent that we can tap into for management positions, so we can tap into markets and make more money."  This is what the corporations were trying to do, of course. "We need to preserve affirmative action policies, as long as there aren't quotas, wherever we can find them."

¡¡¡¡George Bush White House comes out in support of the plaintiffs. The Supreme Court weighs in, and it has a mixed answer. People didn¡¯t know what was going to happen. The mixed answer is that student body diversity is a compelling state interest in the context of university admissions, of university admissions. It's compelling. Race can therefore be a factor in consideration of the application, as long as its use is narrowly tailored. So you see, you know, it's building on the language of the court cases I was already talking about. It reaffirms, therefore--Grutter v. Bollinger reaffirms Bakke, maintains a narrow framework in which to understand Bakke. But then Sandra Day O'Connor says, and does something rather unusual that she's since distanced herself from, she goes, "You know, we need this now."  You know, one of the issues with conservatives, and this is something that, that--oh I just drew a blank on his name. It doesn't really matter. This is a, a, an ideology that many conservatives are saying, "Look, it's been thirty and forty years since the civil rights movement. That's enough time."  And liberals would say, "Ah, what about the previous two hundred?" 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Well, anyway, Sandra Day O'Connor says, "Yeah, we've come a long way, but we're still not perfect as a society in this issue. In twenty-five years--I think about twenty-five years is about right."  How she came up with a number, I have no idea. "But in twenty-five years, it will probably be time to revisit this question."  And you can bet, well, before twenty-five years is up I'm sure, but if by some miracle it's not challenged within twenty-five years, you'd better believe that there'll be a twenty-fifth anniversary of suits against affirmative action, and college admissions, and, and wherever else it's articulated. So the University of Michigan law school had to actually scrap its policy. The University of Michigan had a slightly different policy that supported affirmative action in diversifying its pop--student population, was able to keep it.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now collectively, these cases demonstrate how race works in a legal setting since the civil rights triumphs of the 1960s. Something interesting has happened in these cases, though. In each of these cases, white plaintiffs were the ones who were filing suit, claiming their equal rights had been violated. This is one of the fascinating turn in civil rights law, equal protection law, in the nineties, in the eighties into the nineties. Something I was encouraged, by the way, by Clarence Thomas, when he was the head of the EEOC, that became an organization--it was put there by Ronald Reagan--it was an organization that actually ended up becoming non-functioning as far as supporting claims for racial discrimination, ethnic discrimination, and gender discrimination. The backlog is tens of thousands of cases. But we're in a moment in the 1990s where the equal protection clause of, of the Fourteenth Amendment is used often and to great effect by civil rights advocates over--especially the height of the movement in the fifties and sixties--has now a much narrower application and is used with greater success to roll back some of the more controversial gains of the civil rights movement. So in a sense, the civil, civil rights laws are being used against the policies promulgated by civil rights activism when you get into the 1990s.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡All of this begs the question, is, how race is used in our society. This will really be the lecture--the topic of the final lecture, but it's important to understand the passions. I mean, I've been talking about them in sort of a clinical way that you see in Supreme Court cases, federal court cases, the last twenty or thirty minutes. But the passion of how people use and--use and abuse race hasn't diminished in the wake of the civil rights victories of the 1960s, when the civil rights excesses--again, based on your politics. In the 1970s, for instance, in Boston, Mass--I already talked about the Stuart case in Boston in the nineties. But Boston has a nasty history when it comes to racial and ethnic politics. White ethnic communities in Boston are up in arms. There's a new policy about bussing. They were going to take black kids in Boston--this is a highly segregated city--and bring them into, quote "our schools" and ship our kids out to black schools. "This is an atrocity."  So you have gangs of angry white ethnic Bostonians attacking school buses with children in them, hurling epithets left and right, and acting in the most strug--disturbing kinds of ways, when you think about the politics of racial symbolism and citizenship. I mean, these are some of the core themes with which I began this course.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Theodore Landsmark, an African American man, graduates from Yale with a J.D. in seventy-three, a degree in architecture in seventy-six. Up in Boston, he's walking out of city hall, a well-dressed man, three-piece suit, very professional. At least until recently--he still may be--the president of a, of a, of an arts university in Boston. He steps out into the City Hall Plaza, unaware that there is a mob of these angry white ethnic individuals upset about bussing policies. He's not an activist as far as bussing is concerned. He's not one of the, the people on the front lines calling for change, but he is black. And that's all that mattered to the person who approached him and expressed his idea about citizenship upon, or rather in, Landsmark. Taking the American flag,with a fixed point, and goring Landsmark. He survives. He survives. But if you're thinking that the politics of citizenship, and belonging, and of racial symbolism--wrapped up in this case in just a black man walking out of city hall--if you think those were politics of a different era, going back prior to the sixties and fifties and earlier--this is 1970s--and if you think it's only politics of the 1970s, I think in the last lecture we'll see that it's a problem very much with us in our "post-racial" age. Thank you very much.
¡¡¡¡Lecture 25 - Who Speaks for the Race? (continued) [April 21, 2010]
¡¡¡¡Chapter 1. Introduction and Synthesizing Material Covered So Far [00:00:00]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Professor Jonathan Holloway: We're at that moment. Pardon me a second here. You know, I always find it shocking that you, you get to spring break, and you come back, and you're like, "Oh my god, six more weeks. How am I going to survive?" And the next thing you know, we're at the last week of class, the last lecture. And since it is the last lecture, I want to do a quick survey of the course, and this is truly a quick survey of the course through a whole host of keywords. This is not meant to sum up the entire course, and I'm not saying that all these keywords are going to help you understand your final paper or ace, you know, the in-class exam, for those of you who are going to be taking it. But they, I think, will--they are there to spur more reflection and thought about critical moments, themes, ideologies for the class. And then I do want to bring us up to our contemporary moment and wrestle for a little bit about some of the lessons, discussions, ideas from the past, and how they resonate in our present time. So--is this working?  Excellent. Okay.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So it should--unless you're coming to the class for the first time today, not pre-frosh, who might be here, but people in the class, if, if I have to linger over citizenship, I wish you much luck for the end of the term. Citizenship is one of the, the fundamental issues that I've been talking about throughout this course, whether it's the active attempt to deny citizenship in the, in the pre-emancipatory moment and the post-emancipatory moment, or whether it's just the various ways individuals, state actors, ideologies, have worked to police who could belong and not belong in the American pantheon. Representation, I¡¯m talking about it, how¡ªI, I mean, think about it in the way that we use cultural symbols to represent other things, the ways in which different ideologies of the self, in terms of racialized self-representation, ethnic, sexual orientation, gender, all of these things representing a whole body, as it were, of political positions and ideologies.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡One of the great things that is there through the beginning of the course and all the way to the present day is really the wrestling and the balance between where does one's rights as an individuals run into--[Student Sneezes] Bless you--run, run into larger issues dealing with the social fabric, individual liberty versus social equality. And you can certainly translate that into, metaphorically, into states' rights versus federal rights as well. This is a major thing that we've been talking about, I've been trying to impart to you the last couple of lectures, certainly, but it's been there throughout the course, the great divide between the rhetoric of our political leaders or our political activists, politically engaged people, and what social reality is. This is certainly an important thing to wrestle with, think about, in the last twenty or thirty years--well, gosh, now thirty or forty years, in our post-Civil Rights Movement era. But how can we talk about race as it's lived on the ground, and not--as a politician or activist?  How can I talk about race as it's lived on the ground without being tarred, correctly or incorrectly, as being racialist or racist in my thinking? 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Dealing with issues of leadership of course, and uplift. These come together, certainly if you think back to earlier part of the course and the complicated politics, often class politics and gender politics, all woven through with race politics, about what does uplift mean?  What does it mean to lead the race?  Uplift them to what, uplift them from what?  Uplift them, but so far. These are all these kinds of things we talked about. Chronologically speaking, mainly I talked about them at the turn of the century going into the twentieth century. Part of uplift, part of uplift is respectability, people acting in a respectable fashion, but that's certainly not a phenomenon that limits itself to the late nineteenth century, early twentieth century. I mean, think of the images of the civil rights activists that we saw, that, that we've grown up with: you know, young men and young women having to dress in a certain way, comport themselves in a certain fashion. Think of the stories I talked about with the Little--Little Rock Nine or the, the men who integrated the Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina and started the sit-in movement. Think of the way that Martin Luther King had to present himself, felt the need to present himself, the test case individuals who end up--their cases go up to the Supreme Court. They had to reflect or embody the kind of values that they felt the nation could understand. These are the most respectable people, and how can we deny them their citizenship rights? 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡The gender, of course, and its see--and it¡¯s seeming invisibility. Throughout the course and its readings, I know in sections as well, issues have--of, of gender have been ever present. They're always present, and in some weeks more explicitly than others, but the way in which women's and men's rights or, quote, sensibilities--I use that term very gently in a fully loaded fashion--shift how we deal with individual rights, social equality, certainly, who can be a citizen?  Thinking of things on the ground, you have the migrations, the Great Migration her--happening in the early part of the twentieth century, the much larger migration as far as numbers happening in the 1940s and 1950s, and coming along with the relocation of African American bodies is also the relocation of African American culture, forms of cultural expression, politics, organizing logics, traditions, and also resistance, and unrest, and riots, and bloodshed.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡At different moments in the course I talked about cultural politics, whether the Harlem Renaissance or the New Negro Renaissance, and introduced the idea, at least for this course, about the belief by many of the leaders of the Renaissance that practicing cultural politics in this way, talking about exceptional cultural talents of the race, was absolutely a politicized act. That by recognizing the cultural gifts of black people in the world, think to the connections, the complicated connections, to African cultural roots, but by talking about the cultural gifts of African Americans, the nation would understand these people have made a contribution and they needed to be recognized in such a way and have their citizenship rights respected.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Certainly throughout the course, we've been talking about political radicalism, but, you know, keep in mind this is chronologically contingent. The NAACP were a bunch of crazy radicals--The leaders of the NAACP were a bunch of crazy radicals in 1909, always espousing middle-class norms, but still radicals. By the time you get to mid-century, they aren't necessarily the radicals, you know, and they're trying to silence people like Rob--Robert Williams, saying blacks need to arm themselves. It's like, "We can't have that in our association."  And then by the sixties and seventies, you know, they're yesterday's news as far as the young radicals are concerned. What is radical is contingent upon time and place.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Certainly when you think about the civil rights movement in particular, as I, you know, remember, I slowed down the pace of the course dramatically, because the iconography of the Civil Rights Movement is so powerful, it's one of the defining characteristics of our, of our modern--I mean modern in the last forty years, let's say--of our modern conception of what it means to be an American. It means that we all supported Martin Luther King, after all. We all overcame, you know, the struggles that people with a less sharp vision created. Well, the fact is, that's all a myth. There's only a minority of a minority who were on the front lines with King and other people, and of course, King being iconographic himself and many other people involved. And there's profound resistance, individual, institutional, cultural, to change in the movement. But the iconography gives us a kind of simplified notion of the civil rights history that does a disservice to all the real struggles on the ground, and all the complications that come along with being a human being.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Talk of the triumphs of--I mean, two great iconographic moments were the signing of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Moments where it seems that African Americans finally had their full rights as citizens. But you need to understand, this might connect across the way to political rhetoric versus social reality. So you can pass all the laws you want to pass, but unless you enforce those laws, it doesn't mean anything. So the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts were signed and ushered in a, a new day for all American citizens. There¡¯s no minimizing that fact; it did. But you also have to look at enforcement, you have to wrestle with the phenomenon that, say, the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board, saying "we need to end, end segregation with all deliberate speed."  And these things are still tied up in court cases, to this day. Enforcement being very critical when it comes to citizenship rights and the law.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Heading more towards our contemporary moment, of course, where we've been for the last four weeks of the course--no, I'm sorry, last two weeks of the course--with greater focus is post-civil rights America. What does it mean to be post-civil rights?  Historians are actually actively debating this right now, wondering if we ever got to a post-civil rights moment, and also wondering, did the civil rights--and I've already mentioned this in the course, did the Civil Rights Movement begin, say, in fifty-four?  Can you actually identify the beginning?  Did it end in sixty-eight?  Can you identify an ending, actually?  So, we all use the phrase post-civil rights, I mean, I use it as well. But we need to understand that it's loaded with complications. It's a highly nuanced term that's never thought about in a nuanced way or used in a nuanced way, except for you guys after this glass.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Racial symbolism has been there from the very beginning, the founding of this country, before the founding of this country. It is a phenomenon that exists as long as people have eyeballs. Now, it is a defining characteristic of this country. It¡¯s--John Hope Franklin, the historian I mentioned in the last lecture, who headed up the President's commission on the, the National Conversation on Race, you know, said this is America's original sin. This is the scar that really defines the country. Angela Oh disagreed with him to the, to the extent to which he thought--she thought that that was a really useful way of thinking about things, but the fact is, as I mentioned in the very first lecture, that--arguing you cannot understand American freedom, one of our most core values, without understanding slavery. And you can't understand slavery without understanding its racial dynamics.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 2. Barack Obama: The First African American President [00:12:39]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Of course, racial symbolism carries forward till today and that's what I'll actually be talking about a fair amount in today's lecture, about just that. And, in fact, as I think about it, this used to be the last keyword I'd have on the screen. There's many other words I could pick and choose, but I thought this was a nice way to get into the lecture on racial symbolism. But now we've got this one to deal with, "post-racial."  What does it mean?  What can it possibly mean?  I mean, the, the, the, the simple answer is that we've now come to a place that as a country, we've elected an African American President. Who that "we" is, is contingent, of course, and even an African American President is contingent, of course. But now that we have done this great thing, we can now get past this great burden that has--that we have of being consumed with racial politics, everybody. And, goodness, I'm forgetting the talking head that said as much, but after Barack Obama's election, it's like, "Look, African Americans, basically you've got nothing else to complain--I don't want to hear any more whining."  Who was that?  Somebody here knows this. It wasn't Chris Matthews. He thought for a second he was going to be able to forget Barack Obama's black, for about an hour, he was that--that was a triumphant moment for him. I'm forgetting who it was, but it was actually a quite famous comment that, "All right, you have nothing else to complain about. You've, you¡¯ve got your guy in office." 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡What does it mean to be "post-racial?"  I actually had a conversation about this the night after Barack Obama was elected. I was in Commons--Calhoun was in renovation then--and there was one other student. I was getting there late, and there was one other student from Calhoun in the section, so I sat down across from her. I'm like, "Wow, this is quite a remarkable moment, isn't it?"  And she said, "Professor Holloway, we just, you know, we, of our generation (which is a reminder of yes, I was twice her age), you know, we don't think about these things this way. We're post-racial."  And, you know, I don't want to overburden the race, but this is an African American student I happened to be sitting across from. And she goes, you know, "This is something that your generation (thanks, once again, for reminding me I'm twice your age) that you guys are all con--consumed by."  And the--What she wouldn't know is, you know, I don¡¯t remember any of this stuff. I was too young for that consum--consumptive moment of the Civil Rights era. That's the moment of my birth. So she was like, "We just don't talk about these things. We don't think about these things."  And I walked away from that conversation thinking, "My god, she's actually right."  That we don't talk about these things and we don't think about these things, but is, is that what it means to be post-racial?  And if it does, I'd say we're actually in a whole bunch of trouble. Is it a generational change, or is it something a little more complicated?  And I'll argue that it's more complicated.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So that was the night--the day after Obama was elected, and then of course he's inaugurated. And it was fascinating to me, I mentioned this once before in the lecture, that this--I mean inaugurations, regardless of who's taking office, pretty phenomenal moment, and a moment I get very patriotic about, even if I don't like the person who's taking office. The peaceful transition of power, it's an astonishing thing. But as the--and the, and the inauguration, I mean the pomp and circumstance and all the, you know, the symbolic weight of the moment is, I think, really quite powerful. This inauguration was really quite different. It was texturally rich in a way that an--other inaugurations weren't, and this from somebody who studies the African American past. You have Aretha Franklin singing "My Country, 'Tis of Thee."  You know because I've offered the prompt, I think that's kind of important, for reasons I'll let you explore. You have Reverend Joseph Lowry, a leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, one of King's inner-circle, gets up to offer his prayer. And a fascinating thing happens, sort of after the fact. From the first moment he gets up there and, and starts talking, I'm like, "Wow, this is really powerful. I know exactly what he's doing. He's reading, narrating, the first words of the, quote, National Black Anthem." 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡And what was astonishing to discover is that in a way that I, I just sort of found amazing, in a sense that I was so close to the topic, I didn't think that others didn't get what was going on, but that the inaug--that, that many people, white Americans, and other Americans, different types, and certainly some black Americans as well, had no idea what he was talking about, when he was reciting the lines to Lift Every Voice and Sing. And it made it clear to me, is that that inauguration, from a textual point of view, was experienced in very different ways. There's the obvious point of view: there's a black President, you know, overwhelmingly--overwhelming majority, a super majority of African Americans voting for him, a, a mixed bag depending on different categories beyond that, of who voted for Barack Obama. So it's the obvious way in which the inauguration's experienced differently. But from a textual standpoint, and the way in which the inauguration was really quite historically minded, was really quite something, and the way that that history was experienced or acknowledged differently, that many people basically didn't understand the subtext of Aretha Franklin's performance, or the subtext of Reverend Lowry's performance, or even the night when Obama was elected, at Grant Park in Chicago, his invocation of words that are sort of central to the Civil Rights Movement heritage, quotes Martin Luther King, but never references King. It's really quite something, actually, the way in which Obama or his inner-circle are making all of these connections often to the African American past, without referencing it. Maybe that's post-racial, I don't know.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now when Obama was running for office, so two years ago, in this course at the one of the very first lectures, I was saying, you know, "Look, I'm not going to talk--"--you know, Hillary Rodham Clinton and, and Barack Obama were shaping up to be the major contenders for the Democratic Party, the nomination, and I told the class, "Look, I know this is rather important. Of course it's important. It's an historic elec--election for the Democrats no matter what. I'm not going to talk about it at the beginning of the course. I'll talk about it in the last lecture."  What I wasn't telling the students is like "when Hillary Rodham Clinton will probably heading--be heading towards the nomination, and Barack Obama will have dropped out."  In my head, it's what I was thinking. Thinking of the history of, of, like the "Angry Hands" advertisement with Harvey Gantt and Jesse Helms, I frankly presumed it was just a matter of time when we started going to the ballot boxes and the, the voting booths that, although people were curious and excited about this eloquent junior senator, that when it came to actually casting the vote that--I thought that Hillary Clinton would basically run away with it.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡And then Obama goes on what was an eleven state tear, something like that, crushes the history of what Jesse Jackson had done. And I'm realizing during the course, like "Oh boy, I've got to rewrite the end of my course."  This is act--something, something different is happening here. And then, as we are heading towards spring break, that moment of, you know, "Boy, we're all so tired and we've just got to struggle through the last six weeks of the course," then the news starts to break about Reverend Wright, Obama's pastor in, in Trinity Church, Rev--Reverend Jeremiah Wright and his racial views, a church that he'd been leading for a long time and Obama had gone to. And what happened next was actually, I thought, rather predictable. There's lots and lots of hot air, all sides of the political--all spots in the political spectrum weighing in about Reverend Wright's racism, or his racial honesty, and everything in between, and where--what's Obama thinking?  What happened after that was, I thought, quite astonishing though. Obama gives his so-called race speech in Philadelphia, "A More Perfect Union," that two years ago in the edition--actually, even last year, I believe, in the edition of the, the Manning Marable reader--was it even in last year's edition?  No, it wasn't there yet. They, they re-purposed the book, and that's in the documents now.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now there was the expected repudiation of some of Wright's views in Obama's speech. People expected that. But, remarkably, there wasn't an apology. It's kind of astonishing. Obama addressed in his speech Wright's ideas, as one would expect, distanced himself from some of them, but he gave a lecture really, and I think lecture is the appropriate word, on the scar of race throughout American history. It was an acknowledgement that everyone had to be more honest about racism, everyone, about the racism they express or feel, and that they had to recognize that race was often used as a veil, as it were, to mask other issues. Think back to Du Bois where, you know, people who were black hid behind a veil, or put--society put a veil in front of them. Obama's talking about a different way, that race is the actual veil that's shielding, hiding, obfuscating other issues. Obama also said that there were lingering scars that we as a nation had to admit to. We had to admit to all of this and recognize that the feelings were still very real, and that Wright's views made sense, even though they might sound repugnant to many people, that they made sense to many people as well in the African American community. And that if we're ever to get beyond any of this, it was time that we actually be honest about this scar, and how we can make a better world. It's a powerful speech.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡I was actually on spring vacation and really trying to be on spring vacation. I was in Florida with my family. And I knew that he was going to give this speech, but I also knew that I had, you know, rented a boat that I was going to--by goodness, I was going to take that boat out, and so I was going to miss the speech. And I get, we get back after the day, and there's messages on my email, email and my voice mail, from different reporters wanting comment. I'm like, "Oh, guess the speech actually was well-received, or controversial, or something."  I didn't know the first thing about the speech. Then I start seeing--looking at the email more carefully--or the headlines, I'm sorry. "The most important political speech in the nation's history."  "The most important speech since Gettysburg."  "More important than I Have a Dream."  I'm like, "Oh my, what the heck did this man say?"  I've got to find out. So right away I go to CSPAN, and they already have it posted. So I, I watch, listen to the speech, and what I found so astonishing in this--I mean, I already told you the things I thought were important about it, but a major reason that it was astonishing is that our national discourse on race is so impoverished that they didn't know how to handle a very honest and rich speech that's full of complication and nuance. People didn't know what to do with it, and certainly didn't know what to do with it from a, a politician running for something. Who gives a speech like that when you're running for office? 
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡ 
¡¡¡¡Chapter 3. How is Race Used? [00:25:17]
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡The fact is, race is easy at its surface. It¡¯s--allows us to ignore more complicated realities. It allows us to engage in simple coding of behaviors, of people, of types. It's a social convention, essentially, that, that is in each of us, racial thinking. And I'm not ab--I¡¯m not absolving myself of that either. I'd be a liar if I were. What I want to do for the rest of the lecture is talk about how race is used, something historically, certainly. It's all grounded in history, but also bringing it up to the contemporary moment. I don't want to, I don¡¯t want to overburden the importance of the speech. It was, I think, an important speech, certainly, but I want to build off of sort of the way we can use moments like this to think historically, and with nuance, and also about our contemporary moments.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So I want to look, talk about how race is used. Now we know from other moments in the course, but also on Monday's lecture specifically, that race is used to criminalize. I mean, this is something I've made quite plain, and you have--I don't have it today; it would just be repetitive, but in the case of O.J. Simpson, certainly with the Time magazine cover and darkening his features to make him look more like a criminal.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Race is used in that way, okay, but in this case, thinking about the way that race is the veil that hides other things. O.J. Simpson's race allows us to ignore the fact that we're talking about a really wealthy man in that case. Was it about a superstar and his ex-wife?  Was it about a black person and his--and a black man and his white wife, ex-wife?  Or was it about someone with a lot of power, cultural capital and money, and someone who doesn't have it?  Race would, I mean, we got so fixated on race in that trial, we ignored the class dynamic. And I only linger on this for a half second, because at the same time, I think in California, a rather similar set of circumstances transpired with a black man and his white wife. He did not have money. Curious sets of, you know, evidence, abuse, and whatever. The guy was put in jail and never heard from again. Can't ignore the role that money plays in a situation like that, but race allows us to walk around it. Race is used in that way. It's used to distract.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡It's used, of course, to sell products, and these are some images that you may remember--things like them from Ethnic Notions very early in the term, being used to sell Cream of Wheat. It says here, "Maybe Cream of Wheat ain't got no vitamins. I don't know what them things is. If they's bugs, they ain't none in Cream of Wheat, but she sho' good to eat and cheap. Cost about one cent for a great big dish."  Sung by Rastus, which is one of the, the caricatures of the, the happy servant, the loyal servant. Now Cream if Wheat isn't sold this way now, but in the early 1970s, it had just moved away from this. I remember, this was when I was eating Cream of Wheat. Certainly, you know, the vernacular dialect had disappeared at that point, but Rastus Anonymous was still there, selling Cream of Wheat. More famously, you have Aunt Jemima: pancakes, southern cooking, the matron, the, the mammy figure, with her natural knowledge of how to take care of people.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡As you head into the 1980s and nineties, people think, you know, "This might be a little dated, this, you know, Aunt Jemima figure. Maybe we should revisit it."  And they did, and so Aunt Jemima lost the doo-rag, and the, you know, the handkerchief, and the other conventional dress, got an up-do. You can't see on the pic--the, the, the quality of the image is poor--a nice set of pearls, so when she comes back from work, like she can still make great pancakes for you, but, but she got updated, she got professionalized. People were getting a little bit queasy about the lingering vestiges of what many people felt was the racism being used to peddle pancakes. And I'll be honest, I mean I grew up with Aunt Jemima in the house, and for the love of god, I didn't understand why. I mean, I didn't have the words or the education then to really understand what, what I was feeling, but something I found really--it kind of bothered me. And I was not a little Malcolm X running around, you know, trying to, you know, beat down the man and do these things. It just didn't feel right, but I didn't know why. Then my family switched to Vermont Made, which is loaded with all kinds of other kinds--you know, it's, it¡¯s all bad syrup, frankly, but, but--and I don't know what Aunt Jemima pancakes taste like, because I don't eat them anymore, but I know people do swear by them.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡But if you don't want pancakes, maybe you want rice. There's Uncle Ben. Growing out of the same tradition of Rastus and Aunt Jemima, loyal and happy servant, and they're all smiling, right?  Well, Uncle Ben has been peddling rice pilaf, basically, a whole variety of rice products, for the longest time, and then the ad people started getting a little nervous about Uncle Ben and thought, "Maybe this is not really--let's distance ourselves from Uncle Ben."  And so he disappeared from the packages. Then about five years ago, he reappeared. I think, I think Proctor and Gamble, they own pretty much everything, decided, you know, "It's time. I think we can do this. I think we can have a more historically rich and nuanced understanding of Uncle Ben."  And so much like Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben got a job. And I did not check before today's lecture; it was certainly the case last year. If you go to¡ªand don't do it now, I mean half you guys¡­But, if you go to Uncle--you know, Google Uncle Ben, you get the website. It's a beautiful website. You walk into the CEO's office and guess whose office?  It's Uncle Ben's office!  He's no longer Uncle Ben, though, he's just Ben. Still doesn't have a last name. The first name being a very important tradition of, of southern social hierarchy is that black men and women are always talked to by their first name, whether it was actually their first name or not, you know.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡So Ben is, Ben--it's, it¡¯s not CEO Gates; it's just Ben. And the website, it is, it was really quite a work of art, but in the version five years ago, you could walk around his desk and open up the day planner, and it would talk about him, "wink, wink,"--and I'm very closely paraphrasing--having libations with the southern sen--southern, southern senator. You know, "this is the way we do business," or something like that. I thought, "Wow, so somebody thought it was appropriate--"--I mean, they'd already given Ben a big raise. He's the CEO. They thought it was appropriate, though, to harken back to a tradition of good old boys and behaving inappropriately, and now CEO Uncle, Uncle CEO, is one of these boys. I mean, think back to Birth of a Nation and the story of the black Reconstruction governments, and they're eating chicken legs--oh no, turkey legs, and drinking, and taking their shoes off. It's in that same kind of tradition. That's kind of astonishing. I went back last year, that thing's gone. The rest of the site is still there, but that part is gone. So someone raised a fuss. I mean, when, when they brought Ben back, there was a whole bunch of, like "Wow, this is a crazy idea."  But still Ben is--at least, at least through last year--I didn't check the website last night, and I don't shop for Uncle Ben's, so I don't know if he's still smiling at us in the, in the aisle ways. I suspect that he is.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now this is--corporate makeovers are not limited just to the African American experience. There is a campaign to freshen Betty Crocker, the face of Betty Crocker, and you see her through the ages from 1927 until she ends up, well, looking like a wise Latina, perhaps, in 1996. And when, when, when this makeover came about, there was a lot of discussion, like wow. I mean Betty Crocker didn't say, you know, what ethnic identity she was supposed to have. She was just Betty Crocker. People think that looks like, you know, a very professional Latina. And heck if you look at the demographics of this country, that may be a smart marketing trend, going, going ahead a couple of decades. So race is used to sell things, absolutely, and this is just barely the tip of the iceberg. It's still being used to sell things.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Race is also used to suggest progressive commitment to equality. University, University of Wisconsin, year 2000, put out a magazine for something like "Bulldog days," frankly, for their version of it, ¡°Badger days," I don't know. I'm making that up. But, but this was a brochure they'd hand out, a magazine, talking about all those great things that Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin, has and does. Exactly the kind of thing you would expect from a university. I've absolutely no quarrel with the content of the magazine. So that's the image, that's the copy of the image, and if you look, follow the--my mouse, you see all of these happy students at probably a football game. And then you see him, a happy African American student at a football game. That's, that¡¯s great. Here's the real image. He's not there. Now, you have to go back ten years. Photoshop was very new, okay. This was just being rolled out. And the idea--now we--you've grown up with--I mean, everything is Photoshopped, right?  It wasn't in 2000. This was a new technology, and so they took--someone who was looking at the magazine said, "You know, it's funny, because the light's all coming from a certain angle here, but it's coming from a different angle over here. And, you know, it just kind of--just the, the biometrics don't seem quite right," and someone slipped the actual--this is what the cover is.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now actually, I have a friend I recruited from the University of Wisconsin, Professor Blackhawk. Some of you may know him. He actually brought--and I meant to bring it today, I forgot--one of his friends at Wisconsin is still there, and gave to him to give to me the actual copy. I mean, I actually have one of these things. It's very cool. And then here's the real image. Now this young man, as it turns out--and this was taken at, at, like a student bazaar. He was a very happy University of Wisconsin student. He was a student leader. He was engaged in all kinds of things. There's no doubt that he was enthusiastic about being at Wisconsin, but the fact is, he wasn't there at that moment. And you can see, they actually turned the face in the opposite direction, did all of these different things. Now Wisconsin is not trying to say black folks aren't welcome. They're trying the opposite. "Look, there's a black person at the football game!  We are a school that--"--I mean, and, and, it does not, it's not a diverse school. It's not a diverse state, but they are really trying, in this publication at least, symbolically, to try to do something different. Race is used in socially progressive ways, even if sometimes accidentally.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡This is a statue at North Carolina A&T in Greensboro, very close to Woolworth's where the sit-in movement began, and this is a representation of the four men who are now university heroes. And if you go to downtown Greensboro which was, after the textile mills closed, there's nothing in downtown Greensboro. My grandmother lives nearby, so I was driving around and come across--you can't see here--February One Street. I mean, "That's a weird name for a street," and it turns out it's right at the intersection of the Woolworth's building. And Woolworth¡¯s building--oh and there's placards in the, in the ground, representing the four men walking there, and this is the, the Woolworth's building, the site of the Woolworth's building, that the city fathers wanted take--they wanted to eliminate the history of the Woolworth's building and the sit-in for the longest time. It's an embarrassing part of Greensboro's history. Preservationists said, "You've got to save this thing," and then people got together and, for years, were working on building an international civil rights center and museum. It took well over a decade and they actually just opened up this February, on the fiftieth anniversary of the sit-in. I haven't been to it yet, but I'm looking forward to going.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡But, so, what does this matter?  How, how is race being used here?  There is nothing in Greensboro any more. Southern cities, now that industry has gone, are re--trying to rebuild their downtown cores by creating heritage sites. A place of social, and political, and racial shame is now being turned into--and the, the New York Times review said it's a fantastic museum--a place to draw in tourist money. Birmingham is the same way. The, the attack dogs that Bull Connor released, had released, to go after the student pro--the, the, the protestors , you know, at the park, there--it's now a memorial. You have the, the, the, German shepherds frozen in a very modernistic pose. People travel throughout the South in bus rides, sometimes organized by universities, to witness these places. There's a lot of money at stake. Race is being used. It's used in a conflated way to honor and to sell a product. This is an image that needs no narration. You know, it's King at the "I have a--"--March on Washington. An advertisement, "Before you can inspire, before you can touch, you must first connect."  It's by Alcatel, a wireless phone service in 2001, and a suggestion. You know, even whether it's Photoshopped or just a, you know, created image, that if only King had a good cell phone service, we'd have something different.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡Now you all grew up after, I guess, Forrest Gump was out, but this was very controversial when it came out, very popular but controversial, with historians, like "What are you doing, you know, playing around fast and loose with history like this?" As Forrest Gump--this was, they leave characters all over the place, and wondering what--how history would have been different, you know, in this case, had King had a different product, and just as Forrest Gump was, you know, there at all these places, you know, changing history quite by accident. Americans are really bad historians, so professional historians get anxious when they see something like this, even though it may be clever. Now King is certainly a political football, whether it's the California Civil Rights Initiative or, you know, progressives, conservatives, they all use King. In the Oakland school district--goodness, about, I want to say seven or eight years ago now--there was a major debate about Ebonics. The question is, Ebonics, would it be recognized as a form of American dialect, and if it was--English dialect, and if it was--there would be actual institutional support for helping these kids who speak Ebonics, nonstandard American English, to help them with extra support and tutoring, you know, in Ebonics vernacular, as a way to be--eventually mainstream them. Clear representation of King, you know, "I has a dream," that would be, you know, King if he were speaking in Ebonics. And the text is very small down here and it says,
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡    "Does this bother you?"  (This is from, [clears throat] excuse me, October ninety-eight. I just have the date here, I'm sorry, ninety-eight.)  "Does this bother you?  It should. We spent over four hundred years fighting for the right to have a voice. Is this how we'll use it? More importantly, is this how we'll teach our children to use it?  If we expect more of them, we must not throw our hands in the air and agree with those who say our children cannot be taught. By now you've probably heard about Ebonics, aka, aka black English, and if you think it's become a controversy because white America doesn't want us messing with their precious language, don't. White America couldn't care less what we do to segregate ourselves. The fact is, language is power and we can't take that power away from our children with Ebonics. Would Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and all the others who paid the price of obtaining our voice with the currency of their lives embrace this?  If you haven't used your voice lately, consider this an invitation."
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡African Americans gathering together to purchase this advertisement, railing against other African Americans and blacks and whites, of course, on both sides of the line, about who can speak for the race and what that race is going to say. It's a contemporary history, race, this is a satellite image of Katrina washing ashore. Now there's a lot to be said about race and Katrina. I don't have time to do that, but I want to show you two images from the moment and talk about the way that race factored into it. We all know, of course, you go to, you know, Yahoo! Web pages, you know, any sort of web pages for breaking news, and they have a scroll of pictures, and here's two hundred pictures from a certain event and you can hit the next one, and the next one, and the next one. And they all have a little bit of script, very short description. Now there are journalistic practices about what the photojournalist is supposed to say, the photographer, to describe what he or she is seeing. There are standards about what constitutes finding something, what constitutes stealing something or looting something. So I don't know the facts of these two pictures, about what the, the photographer saw, but this image runs, and it shows two white people having found food in Katrina. And, you know, there¡¯s carrying bags like orange juice or groceries, something like that, in that bag, floating along the way. Two people who found food. The next image, as it happened, was this one, a citizen who, who looted a store, carrying a, a, a  twelve pack or twenty pack of Pepsi, and who knows what in the bag.
¡¡¡¡
The fact is, he may have looted a store. The fact is, they may have found the food. I'm not disputing this, okay?  I'm not engaging it, but the pictures ran right next to each other, and we are all so hardwired to presume that the person writing this sentence, or the editor putting together, has tripped over a racial fault line, that they can't see anything but a criminal in this image, and a citizen in the previous one. And this was part of the rhetoric of, of Katrina, certainly in the way it was reported in the news. Black and brown people are talked about refugees, although they were citizens. But a reason I point to this is to talk about the way that we are consumed with thinking about race, to a point that we become quite blinded by it. I don't have the time for it right now, but let me encourage you to go to, go to YouTube and put in "Mike Myers, Katrina and Kanye West," or just "Katrina and Kanye West," and you'll see more of what I'm talking about: race being used to heighten our emotions, used in ways that either are clarifying or destructive, depending on your point of view.

Race is very much past and present. Even in our "post-racial" age, we have controversies like this one in the New York Post: two cops having blown apart a chimpanzee, "We'll have to find someone else to write that next stimulus bill."  The artist saying, "I had no racist intent at all. It was just, you know, it was an attempt at humor, talking about, you know, the bill was so crazy, it must have been monkeys sitting in a room."  You know, there's a phrase about--where you put a hundred monkeys in a room, you get Shakespeare eventually that--working typewriters--but, but that this is what he was going after. He may have been absolutely honest, but the way that this was perceived, with the long history of connections between African Americans and apes, and the fact the President is behind signing stimulus bills, that the--and there's a history of New York police, cops, shooting unarmed black citizens, or attacking in other ways, that somebody in the editorial process in the New York Post missed the boat entirely. Did not see that this might have been wildly misinterpreted if the artist had no racist intent.

There was no confusion about the intent here. Emails sent out by the mayor of Las Alamedas, California, talking about, you know, now that Obama's elected, we're going to have a watermelon patch on the White House front lawn. What does this image accomplish, aside from the mayor apologizing and stepping down?  You know, is it satire?  Sure, it's satire, but is it also a Rorschach test of how you have someone like, looking like, Barack Obama taking office, and people don't know what to make of it, don't know what to do?  Now we talked about in this course, at the very beginning, racial symbolism, you know, the money we carry in our pocket. You know, and again, it's not showing up well, but, you know, John C. Calhoun in the corner there. Let's not believe that this is past history. Let us recognize the Republican Women's Group in I--Inland, California sent this out in the newsletter, of Obama bucks. He's got a watermelon, the Kool-Aid, a bunch of ribs and KFC. This is our current state of affairs. Race is used in, in the American landscape, in our "post-racial" age, to get us through circumstances that we don't want to call them as being say class-driven, or driven by gender anxiety, or driven by political anxiety. Oh, it's all going to be coded in racial ways. But because, you know, we don't want to be seen as racist, we can't talk about it. We can show it, but we can't talk about it.

So I really want to end then, and just bear with me a couple minutes, we've gone through this entire course thinking--sharing a history of social, political, intellectual, cultural history, of the different ways citizenship has been wrestled over, the way race has been used. The TAs, I hope you will actually join me in giving, giving them a round of applause for helping us through this way and through these incredibly interesting and, and, and vexed conversations. Congratulations. Thank you so much for your help.

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Now I always do something a little bit unusual here. Are--Freshmen, are there freshmen here?  Raise your hands. Stand up, please. Yes, stand up. Stand up for goodness' sakes. I'm out of time, I don¡¯t--I've got to be quick about this thing. This is one of your last classes of freshmen year, and I hope that your experience here has been exciting and wonderful, and I also hope that people will join me in congratulating you in navigating which--what has been a horrible year at Yale for all these reasons we know. And I hope that you will leave this year armed to become a better citizen at Yale. So congratulations, freshmen.

<<applause>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Sit down now. Seniors here?  Stand up. Stand up. I know, because I walked over to Julia. This is one of your last classes at Yale. You're going to get a lot of people congratulating you. I'm not congratulating you at all. A lot of people are going to be telling you how great and wonderful you are. Oh, in the back, can you step over one foot because you're blocking the camera right there. There we go. People are going to tell you how wonderful you are, and you are wonderful, but the fact of the matter is, you now have a responsibility when you leave here, I think. You may disagree with everything I said. That is actually quite fine with me, but I hope that you will engage what I said, and what the TAs have said, and what you said in section, that you will understand it's incumbent upon you to make this a better place, to make it, in Barack Obama's word, a more perf--perfect union. And you've been armed with the history, even if you disagree with it, a history that I hope will make you think and challenge others when they start spouting off in the most unpredictable, or maybe predictable, ways. So I want to congratulate you personally for being here, sticking through it, getting through Yale, and I hope everyone else will congratulate you as well. Congratulations.

<<applause>>

Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Sophomore, juniors, I ain't got nothing for you guys. [Students laugh]  So  I really raise the closing question, the question that animates this lecture: how is race used?  And I simply want to ask you, how will you use it?  Thank you very much. Thank you.
