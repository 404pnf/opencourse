# Lecture 4 IV Bratman on Intention 

## Functional Benefits of Intention 

1. Deliberation curtailment Two aspects: don’t spend too much time; control when you deliberate. Do you need to form an intention to obtain these benefits? Why not just a judgment? 

1. Interpersonal and intrapersonal coordination Do one’s intentions need to be known to achieve these benefits? Does one need to know that they will be successful? 

1. Self-knowledge (Velleman) 

1. Resolving indifference and incommensurability How do these differ? John Broome’s Abraham example. 

1. Resisting temptation 

## Features needed to achieve (at least the first two of) these results 

Control 

Stability 

Consistency 

Means-Ends 

Coherence 

## Why aren’t they desires? 

Consistency requirement; volitional control 

## Why aren’t they beliefs? 

Motivating; volitional control; determinacy in cases of indifference and incommensurability. Do they, however, entail beliefs? 

## Intentional Action and Acting with an Intention 

The video game example (from ‘Two Faces of Intention’): I play a game in which the goal is to hit either of two targets with either of two guns. I am ambidextrous, and so can simultaneously shoot with each hand. If both targets are about to be hit simultaneously, the game shuts down. But I consider that it is worth risking this slight risk in order to increase my chance of hitting one of the targets. Do I intend to hit both targets? Bratman argues that I don’t. Do I intend to hit one rather than the other? But which? So I have no intention, though I do endeavour to hit them both. But, Bratman argues, if I did hit one of the targets, I would intentionally hit it. Other examples: the doctrine of double effect. Are endeavourings really distinct from intentions? 

## Intention and Belief 

If they are not identical to beliefs, do intentions at least bring beliefs with them? The fallen tree example; the library example. Believing not v. Not believing. All-out belief. What happens if we work with credences? What becomes of the video game example? 

## What has become of the Humean Theory of Motivation? 

Modest revision: all intentions must result from desires. More radical revision: they need not. Couldn’t we just start out with intentions? What is the status of the claim that we must start with desires?
