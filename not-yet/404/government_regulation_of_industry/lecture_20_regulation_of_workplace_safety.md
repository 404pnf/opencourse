Why does the labour market help enforce health and safety?

- 	$70 bn dollar p.a. premium because of risk at work. 

- 	Premia do reflect risks associated with job (values of life recovered from this type of analysis). 

- 	Workers and consumers well informed about product and hence enforce standards via reputation effects. 

Can we rely on the market to enforce health and safety?

- 	Adam Smith observed that workers demand higher pay for more risky or unpleasant jobs. 

- 	This depends on: awareness of risk and preference for safety/health. 

- 	Evidence is that some people are prepared to take more health and safety risks (and these are positively correlated). 

- 	Hersch and Viscusi (1990) find that smokers and those who don’t wear seatbelts much more willing to take hazardous jobs. 

- 	What does the above mean for incentives facing firms to lower safety risk? health risk? 

Can we rely on the market to enforce health and safety?

- 	Workers must be aware of the risks they face for the differential wage theory to fully reflect true preferences for risk. 

- 	It does appear to be the case that perceptions about safety risk do match actual risks (U of Mich Survey of Working Conditions). 

- 	However the evidence is that workers are not perfectly informed. 

- 	Wage Premia: 3-5% for chemicals and allied products to 12-15% for lumber and wood products.

Can we rely on the market to enforce health and safety?

- 	If workers can only observe riskiness imperfectly at time of taking a job then they find out more after starting working. They may reassess risk and quit. 

-  1/3 of all manufacturing quits are due to risk. 

- 	Higher job turnover in risky jobs, length of tenure much lower in risky jobs. 

- 	What sort of incentives face firms in this situation: where would they locate, what sort of people might they hire, how much training would they offer workers? 7 

Can we rely on the market to enforce health and safety?

- 	Workers’ compensation claims for damages in the US were $15bn in 1984, $26.2bn in the late 1990s. 

- 	If workers’ know they can get compensation, what effect might this have on their behaviour? 

- 	For fatalities Moore and Viscusi (1990) estimate that fatalities are 1/3 lower because of liability for workers’ compensation. 

- 	Offering compensation may have offsetting benefits in the labour market through lower wages (Viscusi and Moore (1987), why? 

-  Problems may exist in the extent of liability being too great. 

Information Problems

- 	Markets may fail as a result of asymmetric information e.g. about the riskiness of a job or community or about product quality. 

- 	Workers or consumers only know the average risk associated with a job or product. You get market for lemons problem (Akerlof, 1970). What happens?

Information Problems

- 	In the labour market the firm that offers high safety has to offer higher wages than it should have to and this will make it uncompetitive. 

-  Solving the lemons problem: 

-  Self-certification by warrantees or guarantees. 

-  Government determination of safety level. 

-  Voluntary programs (e.g. associations of responsible firms). 10 

Information Regulation

-  Don’t want to ban activity because of uncertainty. 

-  Individuals differ in valuation of risk. 

-  Regulation of use is expensive to enforce. 

-  Information regulation can be very effective: 

-  Drain opener labels: wear rubber gloves, store in child proof location (63% to 82%; 54% to 68%). More do right thing in response to having labels. 

-  Nutritional Labelling and Education Act (NLEA) mandated labelling. Fat level of salad dressing varies even though self-labelled ‘low fat’, after NLEA high fat dressings experienced significant sales decline. 11 

OSHA

- 	Mandate to set health and safety standards for workers from 1970. However Act did not say how to achieve goal. 

- 	2200 staff at Federal level (second to EPA in social regulation), $435m budget, 37493 inspections at Federal level, 26 states run their own programs. 

- 	Traditional approach was adopting a technology based standard whose stringency was limited by their affordability. Fines for violation. What other approaches might exist? 12 

OSHA Analytical Approach

OSHA Analytical Approach

- 	Did not use CBA, only had to worry about firm shutting down as a result of standard. 

- 	US Supreme Court 1981 ruled out CBA, cotton dust standard was ok as as long as technically feasible. 

-  CBA is done via OMB rules. 

- 	Standards setting ridiculed: specifying height of handrail, spacing of posts etc., what should the standards specify.

Is OSHA effective?

- 	Inspections around 90,000 a year (including states). Penalties more like $30m per year. This is very small given the number of workplace locations in the US. Mostly focus is on safety not health. 

-  A rational firm will calculate: 

-  Compliance cost &lt; (probability of inspection) x (no of violations per inspection) x (average fine per violation). Why? 

-  Compare this with impact of labelling on wage demands. Which is more effective in forcing change?

Example: Ruser and Smith (1988) find that OSHA Inspections in the early 1980s decreased injuries by 5-14%. 

Does this analysis address the issue of optimality?

Conclusions on OSHA

- 	Should shift to health market as this is where the more severe market failure is (some evidence that OSHA is doing this). 

- 	Concentrate on high impact inspections (site specific targeting plan since 1999). 

-  Shift to performance not technology standard. 

-  Need to reconsider lack of focus on CBA. 

- 	No obvious need for deregulation of health and safety regulation. 

Conclusions 

- 	Zero safety and health effects in the workplace not achievable. 

- 	Regulatory agency is not the dominant effect on safety and health in the workplace. 

-  compensation claims and wages are much more important than OSHA penalties. 

- 	Regulation should make better use of market based incentives (e.g. via labelling to induce a market reaction).
