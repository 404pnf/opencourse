# Lecture 11 XI Addiction I 

## 1. FEATURES OF ADDICTION 

Should it be limited to certain drugs, or to any behaviour that can exhibit broadly addictive tendencies? Certainly there is good evidence that dopamine is involved, in both human beings and other animals, in response to the main addictive chemicals: alcohol, opiates, cannabis, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, anesthetics (e.g. angel dust), some volatile solvents (glue, whiteout etc). The main exception is LSD and similar hallucinogens, which animals will not self-administer. Different substances give rise to the same distinctive patterns in both humans and animals: steady low dose for opiates; binge and abstinence for stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines, and for alcohol; steady high dose for barbiturates. Evidence is less clear for behavioral addictions. 

Standard features include: 

1. Euphoria on consumption and dysphoria on absence of consumption (though contrast alcohol and cigarettes); primary euphoria (from the alcohol) or secondary (from the behavior that alcohol permits); primary dysphoria (from the lack of alcohol) or secondary dysphoria (from the realization of the damage that alcohol is doing). Note though that with habitual use, it appears that there can be strong motivation without pleasure (Berridge). 

1. Tolerance: more is needed for same effect (often very rapid, e.g. in one drinking bout) 

1. Withdrawal 

1. Craving 

1. Crowding out (three aspects: this thing, for me, now; is this the same as craving?) 

1. Cue and context dependence (Siegel’s rats’ mortality rates: 96%; 64%; 32%) 

1. Desire to quit and inability to do so (this is heavily belief and society dependent) 

1. Relapse 

## DOES ADDICTION INVOLVE CHOICE? 

Distinguish: 

choosing to start on behaviour that will become addictive; 

choosing to keep going once addiction has occurred; 

choosing to become addicted 

Distinguish too between rational and irrational choices. 

## NO CHOICE MODELS 

Against this: (i) theraputic benefits of insisting on agency; (ii) the effects of higher taxes etc. (e.g. Denmark 1918, taxes raised on akvavit increasing retail price by 1200%; per capita annual consumption dropped from 5.1 liters to 1.1 liters; alcohol related mortality rates declined steeply). 

## RATIONAL CHOICE MODELS 

Becker and Murphy: 

Two properties: 

1. past consumption lowers the utility gained from a given level of consumption (cf. tolerance) 

1. past consumption raises the marginal utility of increased consumption (cf. withdrawal) 

Given these conditions are met, an agent with a steep discount curve can rationally getthemselves into a situation in which they consume something that reduces their average utilitybelow the level they would have had without consuming, and then go on consuming it. (This isthe phenomenon that Yaffe describes.) Should this count as addiction? Not obviously. Theperson doesn’t want to quit; if they stopped consuming they would rationally start again; and inso far as they regret starting, this is just regret that they can no longer get the easy rewards thatthey got when they first started. (It is analogous to the regret that someone might have thatthey have spent all of their inheritance, thinking all the while that if they had it again theywould spend it in just the same way.)

Alternatively, even someone whose discount curve is not so steep can rationally continue toconsume a good with this property when some temporary stressful event causes them to firstconsume it (depending on the nastiness and duration of withdrawal). We will consider a muchsimplified version of Becker and Murphy’s model, taking an example from Skog’s paper‘Rationality, Irrationality and Addiction’. (Unlike Becker and Murphy, we assume only onechoice—consume or not—and only one effective level of past consumption.) Suppose that theutility level from abstaining is 80 per period; that the utility level from consuming is 100 in thefirst period, followed by 70 in every subsequent period (tolerance); and that the utility level from ceasing to consume is 40 in the first period after cessation (withdrawal), returningthereafter to a steady rate of 80.

The agent with a discount rate of 0.6 will find it rational to start consumption if they have notconsumed in the past, and will find it rational to continue consuming if they have consumed inthe past (this is what Yaffe describes):

No prior consumption:

Consume: 100 + (0.6 x 70) + (0.36 x 70) … = 205

Abstain: 80 + (0.6 x 80) + (0.36 x 80) … = 200

Prior consumption

Consume: 70 + (0.6 x 70) + (0.36 x 70) … = 175

Abstain: 40 + (0.6 x 80) + (0.36 x 80) … = 160

In contrast the agent with a discount rate of 0.9 will find it rational not to start consuming,and rational to cease consumption if they have already started

No prior consumption:

Consume: 100 + (0.9 x 70) + (0.81 x 70) … = 730

Abstain: 80 + (0.9 x 80) + (0.81 x 80) … = 800 

Prior consumption 

Consume: 70 + (0.9 x 70) + (0.81 x 70) … = 700 Abstain: 40 + (0.9 x 80) + (0.81 x 80) … = 760 

But someone with an intermediate discount rate of 0.7 will not find it rational to start consuming from scratch, but, if they find themselves already consuming, will find it rational to continue: 

No prior consumption: 

Consume: 100 + (0.7 x 70) + (0.49 x 70) … = 263.3 

Abstain: 80 + (0.7 x 80) + (0.49 x 80) … = 266.7 

Prior consumption 

Consume: 70 + (0.7 x 70) + (0.49 x 70) … = 233.3 

Abstain: 40 + (0.7 x 80) + (0.49 x 80) … = 226.7 

This third case does look more like addiction: such a person would not restart consumption if they could stop it; and might genuinely wish they had never started, whilst still rationally continuing. This is the case on which Becker and Murphy focus. 

Herrnstein and Prelec: 

Rather than assuming steep discount curves, another possibility is that people underestimate their own likely tolerance and withdrawal. There is empirical evidence that they do. Given these false beliefs, otherwise rational agents can start consuming, and then find it rational to continue (the primrose path). Again they might have true regret: i.e. they might wish they had never started, and knowing what they now know, they might not start again if they could stop. 

Lowenstein 

Similar to Herrnstein, but now the mistake is that agents underestimate the effects of craving on them. Again, ample evidence of this. Now though we have a split model: the idea is that agents can rationally start consuming; but the effect of intial consumption is to induce cravings, which makes them engage in irrational behavior.
