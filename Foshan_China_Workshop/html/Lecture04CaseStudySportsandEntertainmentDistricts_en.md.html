<h1>Case Study : Sports &amp; Entertainment Districts 案例研究：体育和娱乐区</h1>

<h2>Sacremento, USA (development proposal) 美国, 萨克拉门托（发展计划）</h2>

<h3>Context 背景介绍</h3>

<p>In Sacramento, the capital of California, USA, plans for a new sports stadium to replace the existing ARCO Arena initiated a considered effort to integrate the stadium into the city. The question of how to use it as a catalyst for a new development persisted. The city wondered whether it should (1) construct a stadium as part of a coordinated, multi-use, master-planned site, or (2) construct a stadium without such supporting development. The city commissioned a study to answer this; the resulting plan, for a ‘Sports and Entertainment District,’ has not yet been developed, but the planning process is instructive to Foshan. 在萨克拉门托, 美国加州首府, 建设一个新体育场来替代现有的ARCO竞技场的计划引发了人们如何把这个体育场融入这座城市的深思。如何用它促进新的发展的问题仍在探讨。人们想知道是否应该在这座城市（1）建设一个体育场把它作为一个协调的、多功能的，总体规划的场所的一部分，或者（2）建设一个没有上述配套开发项目的体育场。为了回答这个问题这座城市进行了一项研究;作为一个“体育和娱乐区”，最终计划至今还没有制订出来，但是这个计划过程对佛山还是有启发的。</p>

<p>The proposed site, 240 acres of underused rail yards in the heart of the city, sits adjacent to the waterfront river but is separated from the amenity by an existing highway corridor. Additionally, the site is adjacent to downtown Sacramento, the Central Business District, and the city’s historic area, “Old Sacramento.” 该用地计划占地240英亩，利用市中心未充分利用的铁路区域，毗邻滨水之地的河流，由一条现有的公路通道将福利社区与之隔开。此外，它还毗邻萨克拉门托商业中心区、中心商务区和该市古老的地区“老萨克拉门托”。 </p>

<h3>Key Features  主要特点</h3>

<p>The main reason for developing a “Sports Entertainment District,” rather than engaging in piecemeal development, was to build natural synergies between uses. Several sites were considered for the project, which were assessed based on selection criteria. These incorporated: “Access” to the site; “Arena Factors” based on parking requirements and arena construction parameters, especially the ability to sink the floor 25 feet below ground; “Cost Factors”; “Synergy &amp; Impact” from and to the surrounding area; and “Urban Design,” insofar as new development bettered the city. 之所以开发一个“体育娱乐区”而不是进行零散的开发是因为要在各种用途之间形成自然的增效作用。这项工程考虑到一些场所的建设，这些场所的评估是以选择标准为依据的。其中包括：场所的“通道”；以泊车要求和场馆建设指标参数为依据的“场馆因素”，尤其是能够承受地面下沉25英尺；“成本因素”；与周围地区的“增效作用和影响”；以及“城市设计，”能够最大限度使城市更美好。 </p>

<p>The project was to include several kinds of development: 该工程将包含几种开发类型： </p>

<ul>
<li>A 60-acre residential community with approximately 3,000 housing units at a density of 65 units per acre was planned to be constructed in roughly two phases: (1) low-rise apartments and townhouses, and (2) high-density stacked apartments. The first phase was to be primarily rental; the second, for-sale.  一个60英亩的住宅区，约3,000套住房，密度为每英亩65套住房，该住宅区计划大致分两阶段建成：（1）低层公寓和联排别墅。（2）高密度的高层公寓。前者将主要用于出租，后者用于出售。</li>
<li>Office use was planned in several areas of the site, totaling 4.95 million square feet of space. 计划在新区建设几个办公区域，总占地面积495万平方英尺。</li>
<li>Retail was planned for ground floor areas, the success of which was deemed dependent on the development of the ‘Sports Entertainment District’ rather than just a stadium development. 计划在底层区发展零售业，其成功将取决于体育娱乐区的开发而不仅仅是一个体育场的开发。  </li>
<li>Hotel space was considered, but no firm recommendations were made as to size or quality. Final considerations were to be based on hoteloccupancy and room rates, presumably to be delivered upon by seasoned hotel developers. 考虑酒店的开发，但还没有就其规模或质量做具体建议。预计将由经验丰富的酒店开发商依据酒店入住率和房租定价最终考虑。    </li>
<li>Culture and leisure amenities were incorporated from the beginning. A “Railroad Technology Museum” was planned as a cultural attraction, and open space was inserted throughout the site. 文化和娱乐设施从一开始就包含在内。一个“铁路技术博物馆”作为文化景点被列入了计划。开放空间贯穿整个新区。 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Process and Implementation 步骤和实施</h3>

<p>As an existing rail yard, the primary challenge of the site was supplying infrastructure and utilities; this was a necessary precondition to redevelopment. Access consideration was based on short-term (5-year) and long-term (10-year) requirements. The main efforts were rationalizing interchanges, widening roads, and providing public transportation options. Shuttle bus services were deemed appropriate for heavy-use periods. Surface parking and “backbone sewer, sanitary, and stormwater” systems were important to site success. To develop ‘priority’ infrastructure, plans called for $73 million of investment; ‘recommended’ levels of infrastructure were projected to cost $118 million; and total long-term infrastructure was estimated at $234 million. Development in the southern portion of Foshan involves similar obstacles, as infrastructure provisions are a central concern for the concentrated development that occurs in stadium areas; roads and other access paths to such a high-use area are vital to project success. 作为一个现有的铁路区域，该新区主要的挑战就是基础设施和公用设施的提供；这是进行再开发的必要先决条件。通道的考虑是以短期（5年）和长期（10年）需求为依据的。主要工作是使交叉道合理化、拓宽道路，提供公共交通方式。班车在高峰期被认为是合适的。地面停车场和“主干下水道、公共厕所和雨水排污”系统对新区的成功发展至关重要。要发展“优先”基础设施 ，计划需要投资7300万美元。“推荐”级别的基础设施预计耗资1.18亿美元;长期基础设施共计耗资2.34亿美元。佛山南区的开发遇到类似的障碍，例如基础设施的提供是体育场区域集中发展的重中之重；通往一个如此高度使用区域的道路和其他路径对该项目的成功是至关重要的。</p>

<p>The ability of the market to absorb new developments was also considered a fundamental factor to project success. Documentation suggests that the absorption of new development would be higher in the case of a planned ‘Sports and Entertainment District.” 市场吸引新发展的能力也被视为该项目成功的重要因素。资料表明建造计划中的“体育与娱乐区”能够更好地提高吸引新发展。</p>

<h3>Cost-Benefit Analysis: 成本收益分析：</h3>

<p>Benefits of the project are assumed to be the creation of jobs and economic multiplier effects: “more than $1 billion in construction period impacts to the greater Sacramento region (including approximately 19,500 jobs); and more than $383 million in regional economic impact (approximately 12,700 jobs) annually.” Additionally, the project was assumed to improve city morale and encourage more development -- as well as shift national media attention to the city. 该项目的带来的益处设想为就业机会的创造和经济的倍数效应：“建设期对更广大萨克拉门托地区的经济影响超过10亿美元（包括大约19500份工作）；对地区经济影响每年超过3.83亿美元（大约12700份工作）。”此外，设想该项目还将改善城市精神面貌和促进更多发展--同时把国内媒体的注意力转向该城市。 </p>

<h3>Principles/Guidelines 原则/指导方针</h3>

<p>The point of this study is to consider the real estate benefits that can accrue from co-locating similar uses, and thereby creating an area that is better used than one that develops without oversight. 该研究旨在思考有类似用途的房地产项目在同一地点协同工作获得收益，从而创造一个区域，这个区域比起没有监管自行发展的区域可以更好地被利用。</p>
