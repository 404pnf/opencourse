<h1>Lecture 3 Foshan Planner Feedback:</h1>

<h2>Comments of Deputy Planner:</h2>

<p>There is a change from the first presentation. Your development of ideas is more realistic. You developed the four fields further. </p>

<p>Shan Shui Foshan: Regarding the title – even though it’s good – there are no mountains in reality. I can see you gave preference to Sasaki’s plan with its green axis (vertical) and blue axis (horizontal) – this creates an ecological environment. During exploration, [unclear: us at MIT? Or the Foshan planners?] also discovered Foshan has a lot of cultural assets. So it is appropriate to frame your approach as “Ecological Foshan” or “Cultural Foshan.” </p>

<p>You sufficiently addressed water relationship and the villages. Transportation connections and commercial streets need more consideration. There is a lot of commercial on the periphery of the site and in the villages – for example in the middle village: markets for furniture, fish, and plastic. So the overall development will need to take this into consideration. </p>

<p>For the transport – major consideration given to the North-south connection but also need to consider the ring and how to connect as a network. </p>

<p>So many good ideas – make sure these continue to be communicated to Sasaki.  The other good ideas include: </p>

<ul>
<li>Consideration of the view corridors across the banks.  </li>
<li>Preservation the existing village – demolition of everything is not realistic </li>
<li>Using cultural assets to elevate the city’s image. </li>
</ul>

<p>This is useful to our on-going work. Thanks! </p>

<h2>Glasses/Karaoke – Mr. Jo?:</h2>

<p>The presentation is clear and precise – the focus on the humanity and people and sustainability – is closely aligned with the new national policy.  </p>

<p>Addressing the Transportation questions: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Challenges in implementing and encouraging viable public transit: </p>

<ul>
<li>The problem with public transit use is the habits of people (changing their behavior) even though the government encourages the use of public transit, in reality there are high usage of motorcycles -- personal use has already adapted motorcycles; part of this is due to the inclination of national policy for private transit, although in GZ, they discourage the use of the motorcycle in the core city by not allowing licenses for new motorcycles.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What plans do you have to deal with the increasing number of cars? </p>

<ul>
<li>As for the car industry, it is national policy to encourage the use and development of this industry, and to have one auto per household is a personal goal for many families. This is encouraged by the government policy. The approach is to deal with the problems -- like congestions -- when they come. One way to do this, for example, if you have to register for licenses, you’ll have to bid for it, that will cost a lot of money [my notes say a few thousand USD - Tell] …so they’ll limit the number of licenses </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is the future of the bike in Foshan? </p>

<ul>
<li>My personal opinion is that it should be encouraged (use) in conjunction with public transit, not to be replaced, but encouraged and developed… </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>We would like to raise two questions for more information: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Regarding the preservation of the villages and the transportation modes, you have presented lots of opportunities and strategies, but how to actually do this and implement it … we’d like some more ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ve raised the central theme of using the river as a central focus, and we think the idea of Foshan as a modern river city is a good focus.  What we’d like you to further develop is regarding the two sides, banks of the river, functions, character, identity and views are not yet fully explored… We hope you’ll seriously consider that and further develop it in our upcoming stage. It’s a major concern of the leaders and people of the city </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The questions the Foshan workshop have raised are the same ones that the officials have been thinking about. But the development of the new city is a long process; the first step is the bigger plan and the core (what the planners are looking at right now)…But the Foshan officials plan has stages/phases to facilitate implementation … as such, our plan should consider stages of development in all the topic areas discussed today.  </p>

<p>Our direction is correct, but now should develop more detailed (less conceptual) plans. Suggestion that we pick individual sites and give more detail on them. </p>

<p>Recently the Chinese cities have many concerns about the spatial quality and the thematic color of the city, how that has cultural implication to the character and the image (sienna = red, Beijing = grey; Paris = beige (sandstone)…So what color is Foshan? They haven’t figured that out yet, but they are concerned about the harmony on the basic color of the city to give a harmonious atmosphere to the color of the city (aka the image of the city). A color would allow the city to be harmoniously presented; it is a conclusive statement from the government and a clear projection of the city’s image. For example, in Nanjing, they had a web discussion asking for public opinions on what is the color of the city. </p>

<p>The four thematic foci are very useful for the future development and strategic development, especially the transport and water because my focus is urban infrastructure. On transport: the ideas are good for the different modes, but I would like to remind you that transport is system thinking, so we need to expand the frame to a more global area, including connection with Guangzhou and an even broader regional/more extensive area…but integration of different modes is interesting and useful to us. Please further consider the interface between the systems. It is an emerging concern for us. We want to know how successfully the different modes can interface with each other. We think that will determine the future success of the system. Therefore, we would like a further investigation of the relationships of modes and of how people switch from one mode to another. We want to know how this is done. Foshan officials have visited many cities, they have looked at Denmark and at Manchester UK. Officials think these are good examples that they’ve seen for traffic interchanging, successfully integrating modes of traffic with “zero distance” from one mode to the next. The success of that comes in terms of efficiency and saving energy. All of this has not been considered sufficiently/properly in China.  </p>

<p>Third comment – not sure how deeply to go into the issue – the blue axis is a focus – Foshan is the origin of Cantonese culture, the cradle of it. How this project and specifically the riverbank integrates with culture will be a big source of tourism, how it integrates in to the transportation network will be a big factor and officials are interested to know more about that. So MIT must look at the development of that culture along the river banks and integration with transportation from north and south. </p>

<p>Shan Shui is a good title because it brings a whole romantic sense to the whole area. The 4 topics are on target because those are the areas they are focusing on themselves.  </p>

<p>Particularly interested in water as an asset for Foshan. Suggests: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Look into water, preservation of villages, garden building, wetlands – all these are key to preserving the cultural heritage of the city </p></li>
<li><p>Hopes that when we proceed further, we can integrate our ideas with theirs to create implementable plans in the long run </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Normal mode of thinking in China is to deal with problems as they emerge. Our way of dealing is to anticipate the problems and deal with them in advance (not clear if he means ours by MIT or ours by Foshan). </p>

<p>Considers our work invaluable to their planning process, especially in the long run </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Water transport is very important in Foshan historically – so as a link to cultural preservation and transport, it is critical </p></li>
<li><p>For new towns, the idea of promoting water transport will help to preserve the cultural heritage of Foshan </p></li>
<li><p>Hopes for a scheme with three features: that attracts tourists, convenience for user, and economically feasible </p></li>
<li><p>Currently land use is not totally fixed for the city, so to minimizes traffic between the 2 banks and create an efficient network remains an open question, and he would appreciate if we thought more about how to do this </p></li>
<li><p>In talking about village preservation, didn’t talk about land value at all – issue is whether we should anticipate the increase in land value in connection to the preservation of villages in our scheme… </p></li>
<li><p>What we’ve omitted: haven’t thought about the nightlife activities on the river bank – how can we decorate/light up the riverbanks as a way to attract tourists </p></li>
</ul>
